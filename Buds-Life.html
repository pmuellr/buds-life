<h1 class="page-break">Introduction</h1>

<p>"I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth." -- Lou Gerhig,
July 4, 1939.

<p>The great New York Yankee first baseman Lou Gerhig has always been my hero.
I watch the movie of his life story, "Pride of the Yankees" whenever I get the
chance. He held the major league record for consecutive games played at 2130,
for over 60 years, earning the nickname "Iron Horse." He had great ability,
stamina, courage, and was an all-around good guy. He retired from baseball
after being diagnosed with ALS, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, an illness
which paralyzes and kills within 3 years. Lou died on June 2, 1941, and ALS
has come to be known as "Lou Gerhig's Disease. The slugger faced and fought it
in the same courageous way he played baseball and lived his life. In spite of
his awful illness, he still considered himself very lucky. For various
multiple reasons, especially minimal athletic ability, my own career as an
athlete never remotely approached that of Gerhig's. But I have been lucky in
somewhat different ways, such as getting out of various jams by the skin of my
teeth. There have been lots of close calls, narrow escapes, near misses of
mine, especially early in life.

<h1 class="page-break">Chapter I. Starting out</h1>

<p>NEW YEAR'S EVE , December 31, 1935

<p>Dr. Cyril Savage had just finished getting into the tuxedo which he wore,
reluctantly, once yearly, to the Delphos Club's New Year's Eve party. The
telephone rang, and the operator gave him a call from one his obstetric
patients, Vi Mueller. She thought she might be in early labor, and wanted him
to be aware of this possibility, hoping to keep his celebrating to a minimum.
He reassured her, stating that she was still a good friend, one of his
favorite patients, as well as a great public health nurse.

<p>Sure enough, shortly after midnight on New Year's Day 1936, Dr. Savage was
called to the Mueller home on West Second Street. Most Delphos babies were
born at home in those days, the nearest hospital being 15 miles away, and many
families, including ours, had no car. At 4:15 AM, Maurice James Mueller, Jr.
entered the world, after an apparently uneventful labor and delivery. Dr.
Savage eventually left General Practice to become a proctologist. However,
there is no evidence that he decided on this specialty as a result of
delivering me.

<p>THE NAME

<p>My parents were going to name me either Walter or Raymond. But what else do
you call a kid who is born on his father's birthday, which happened to be New
Years Day at that? The pronunciation of my name was always "Mawr-us," not
"Mawr-eece." It is my understanding that "Mawr-us" is Irish, which reflects my
Irish grandmother's heritage. And "Mawr-eece" just sounded too French for the
German side of the family, who most likely never had a great love for that
nation or its people. I also have never especially liked the French -- maybe
this has been somehow genetically ingrained into my brain. That having been
said, when introducing myself, I sometimes use the French pronunciation -
"Mawr-eece", since it appears to be the most common one, and which most people
seem to understand.

<p>Not many kids are named after both of their parents. But I was also named
after my mother. Her friends called her "Bud," or "Buddy," apparently because
her dad wanted a boy. (She was second born). So, when I was a kid, it was a
natural to nickname me "Buddy." Maybe the folks thought "Maurie" or "Moe"
sounded too Jewish. Although there were no Jews in Delphos at the time, these
names probably would have been politically incorrect for our town.

<p>We always pronounced the family name with a hard "U": "Mew-ler," and not
the softened "U" as in "Muller." The hard pronunciation is more Germanic. Our
family apparently never felt threatened by their German heritage. Or perhaps
they just couldn't afford the 50 bucks needed to officially change the name.
Delphos was over 75% German at the time, so that likely wasn't much of a
problem. The softer pronunciation was an attempt at Anglicization. During
World War II, some German-American families were often ostracized just for
having a German name. These Muellers wanted their name to sound more English,
and went either with the softer form, or changed it entirely, to "Miller."

<p>FAMILY TREE

<p>My dad's father was John, his father Nicholas, whose father was Peter
Mueller. The latter emigrated from Germany. I don't know the exact location,
but most people came to Delphos from Northern Germany, many from the Hanover
area. Helen Moloney, my dad's mother, was the daughter of Michael Moloney. He
was born in County Cork, Ireland, and came to the U.S. during the Great Potato
famine of the 1840s. My grandparents had four children: Cyril, the oldest,
then my dad, followed by Catherine and then Lucille. Granpa Mueller was a
railroader for the Pennsylvania Railroad; Grandma worked in the Cigar Factory
in Delphos, and was said to be a union activist and generally a rabble rouser.
They divorced when my dad was a teenager. Although a really good guy, he never
had many good things to say about his mother. Unfortunately, his attitude
affected me, and I always had a negative attitude toward her.

<p>My mom's parents were Frank and Lauretta Reinemeyer. Frank was a cabinet
maker who also sold Oldsmobiles. He died before I was born, of "double
pneumonia" during a Flu epidemic in 1930. His parents were Ferd and Pauline
(Polly). Ferd was the first white baby boy baptized in Delphos, Ohio. ("White"
as opposed to American Indian). Grandma's father was Joseph Lang, who was born
in Germany - Alsacs-Lorrain in 1858. Rumor has it that Joseph left for the
U.S. to avoid being conscripted into the French army during the
Franco-Prussion War. Maybe this provided more reasons for the family to
dislike the French. Joseph Lang's wife was Agnes Schmidt. My Grandparents
Frank and Lauretta had 7 children in this order: Agnes, then my mom Viola
Lauretta, then Mary (Fuzzy), followed by Charles (Punk), Francis (Petey), John
(Tom), and Bob.

<h1 class="page-break">Chapter II. Preschool Years</h1>

<p>West First Street

<p>We lived in several different locations before I started school. Sometime
during my first few years of life, we moved one street over, to West First
Street. Most of what I know of this house is from photos and family
conversations. I recall a picture of my sister Sue sitting in our outhouse
with her dog, Tawsey. The faithful dog often accompanied her there for visits
during the day, apparently concerned that she might fall in. There is a vague
memory of our next door neighbor, Wendell Davis, whom I was told occasionally
baby sat for my sister and me. I remember him as being a WW I veteran, having
a wooden leg, and a very happy and friendly guy.

<p>North Jefferson Street

<p>When I was 3 years old, we moved down to North Jefferson Street, not far
from the city swimming pool. Our next door neighbors were the Paul family:
Boots and his wife Audrey, their kids Billy, and JoAnn. During the summer, it
was said that Audrey did her ironing in the nude, but I never saw her in
action. Billy was a playmate of mine, two years older and usually had a snotty
nose or some kind of sinus condition. I recall at age 4 being the first one to
report a fire on the roof of the Clossen house down the street. They owned
Clossen Electric in Delphos, and were very thankful to me for telling them
about the fire.

<p>One of my Christmas presents during this time was an electric train. I was
too young to operate it, and my dad and his cronies played with it mostly. One
of these was Bill Wilcox, who was also known to eat dog biscuits when
provoked.

<p>There was some kind of family party at our house one Sunday. My sister and
my cousins, the Meekins girls JoAnn and Nancy conducted some sort of ceremony
or ritual. We had cousin Francis ("Beaver" or "Eenie") Ditto get into the
chest of drawers, closed the lid, and "offered him up as a sacrifice."
Fortunately, we did not lock him in, and there was no permanent brain damage
(as far as I know).

<p>The most vivid memory during this time period was of my sister's bout with
Scarlet Fever. This was before World War II, and prior to widespread
penicillin use. Standard treatment at the time was bed rest and quarantine . I
can remember a man coming to the house and nailing a red "quarantine" sign on
the front door. This meant that we could not leave the house and could not
have visitors for one month. The highly contagious Streptococcus was greatly
feared as the source of the dangerous rheumatic fever. My dad stayed at his
father's house during this time, so he could go to work.

<p>Sue survived Scarlet Fever and the quarantine without complications. But
the inactivity left her in less than optimum physical condition, and the
doctor recommended an exercise program. Someone suggested tap dancing, and
soon both she and I were enrolled in the Lima School of Tap. I was included
because no one volunteered to babysit with me while Mom and Sue went to Lima
for the tap lessons. Getting there was a grind -- there was no family car, and I
began my lifetime battle with motion sickness on the 30 minute Greyhound bus
rides. We took lessons for two years, performing in several recitals as a duet
and also individually. At one program at Lima Memorial Auditorium, I had a
solo routine. But I developed severe stage fright just before making my
entrance, and had to be pushed out onto the stage. I did all of my routine,
but this was to be one of my last public performances as a tap dancer.
However, a special routine would be done much later in Nashville Tennessee by
request of my college roommate Matt Gorham's friends during a visit in early
1955.

<p>Another medical footnote from this house was a bout with severe impetigo.
This skin infection affected my face and scalp. The treatment at the time was
gentian violet applications at night, followed by removal of the scabs the
next morning -- OUCH!! The medication burned like fire, and the torture
continued when the scabs were picked off. As I remember, my mom had to do this
task. She did a good job, as I have no obvious scars from the ordeal.

<p>Also during this time, I was briefly hospitalized at St.Rita's one Sunday
night with possible appendicitis. There is a vivid memory of the painful
finger stick for the blood count, especially the glass slide on my finger for
the white cell differential test. (I did not know what this was at the time).
By the time the test came back normal, my belly pain was almost gone, most
likely the result of gorging myself with dried peaches at the West Side
Grocery Store where my dad worked.

<p>One other "medical emergency" occurred one morning when I shoved a "Kix"
cereal up my nose. Although a skilled nose picker by that time, I couldn't
retrieve it. No one suggested that I simply blow my nose real hard, and I was
again taken to the doctor's office for a very uncomfortable removal of the
foreign body.

<p>Our house was near the city baseball field, and Dad took me to a ball game
one Sunday afternoon. The game must have been exciting, because at one point,
I stood up and yelled: "Son of a Bitch!" It's often funny to see a little kid
swear, but my folks didn't think so -- mom washed my mouth out with soap. I
never swore again in front of my parents.

<p>I was apparently not a very nice kid at that time, and did not get along
well with my sister. I recall hitting her in the head with my toy handgun, for
some reason. With my bad temper, I probably didn't need much of a reason.
Fortunately, she was not seriously injured.

<p>I'm not sure if I was a very happy kid back then or not, but I used to sing
my favorite song a lot - You Are My Sunshine :

<blockquote>
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.<br>
You make me happy, when skies are gray.<br>
You'll never know dear, how much I love you,<br>
Please don't take my sunshine from me."<br>
</blockquote>

<p>North Canal Street

<p>In the early 40's, we moved again. This house was even closer to the pool.
My buddy at that time was Donnie Williams, who later died of polio during the
awful epidemics of the 50's. My own major medical event of this era was a
tonsillectomy. This was done in Dr. Shapiro's office, who was a GP who did
just about everything. I remember being in his office, on the operating table,
when he came at me with a mask. He said "take a deep breath -- this will smell
very sweet." It didn't -- it was the ether mask for my anesthetic, and I fought
the awful-smelling stuff. Later, I woke up with an extremely sore throat, and
demanded the ice cream that had been promised before surgery.

<p>This house was not far from Main Street in Delphos, which hosted the Allen
County Fair each year. For one week, 12 straight blocks were cordoned off for
animal exhibits and various rides like the ferris wheel. We used to watch the
workers set up all of this stuff on early Monday morning. Every day we would
spend most of the day at the Fair. For some reason I would go on many of the
rides and almost always got very motion-sick. Especially bad were the
"Octopus," and the "Whip," but I could even get sick on the "Merry-Go Round."
I just never seemed to learn not to go on the rides.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">Chapter III. Starting School</h1>

<p>West State St. 1941-42 .

<p>After one year at North Canal Street, we moved to Grandma Reinemeyer's
house at the end of State Street, next to the railroad tracks. For one year,
our family shared this tiny house with Grandma Reinemeyer, the four Meekins:
My mom's sister Aunt Mary and Uncle Fay Meekins and their three kids: JoAnn,
Nancy, and Mike, plus dog Daisy May. Later, there would be two more
Meekins -- Mary Alice (Cookie), and Tom. This was plenty of people for this
little house, but after my Uncle Pete Reinemeyer left for the army, his wife
Donna and there three kids, Frank, Judy, and Donny Kay also moved into the
house. We did have some good times, especially with the Meekins, and they
would ride us around in their very old jalopy -- "Old Bessy." My closest
cousin-pal was JoAnn Meekins. Although she was five years older, for some
reason we connected, and would communicate for several years. There was only
one bathroom in the house, so all of us required lots of patience - or some
other virtue, to survive.

<p>Like my other grandparents, Grandma Reinemeyer was not a very likable
person, Maybe the presence 10 kids in the hours made it worse. We kids were
not allowed to go into her living room or open the refrigerator. She was
probably around the same age as I am now, and memories of her hatefulness have
probably influenced me to try very hard not to be an old crank in my old age -
At least I'm trying!

<p>At age 5, I had the measles. Uncle Tom Reinemeyer, my mom's brother and
always my favorite uncle, woke me up one morning early in '42, to say goodbye
before he left for the army and World War II. The other Reinemeyer uncles were
also army men. Uncle Charles spent most of his time in the South after he
broke his leg. Ironically, Uncle Pete, the only married brother at the time,
saw the most combat. He landed in Sicily and fought in the Battle of the
Bulge. He also had a hemorrhoidectomy, won the Bronze Star and Purple Heart
(Not for the hemorrhoids). Uncle Tom was in the South Pacific, mostly in
Hawaii, and Uncle Bob was in the medical corps and spent time in Germany.
During this War, most men were away from home for three or four years, without
furlough, and my uncles were no exception. They didn't get home until 1945,
and I missed them a lot. The big thing for kids back then was to play "army,"
and we had lots of play guns, toy airplanes, and all the war stuff. For me
back then, war was fun.

<p>My career as a lifetime student had begun in 1941. Very few kids went to
kindergarten at the time. My parents tried to start me in school in first
grade at St. Johns probably earlier than I should have. At the time, a kid was
supposed to be age 6 by December 31. My birthday being January 1, I missed the
deadline by one day. I don't recall being terribly anxious to start school at
the time. But my parents apparently were -- I suspect they just wanted to get me
the hell out of the house. I was permitted a trial at first grade, but the
first day was a disaster. When I came home after class, mom asked me how it
went. I said ok, but I felt sorry for this one kid, who didn't even know his
name. Mom asked what his name was, and I said it was something like " Mawreece
Mueller." I knew my first name, but only when pronounced " Mawruss ," not the
other way. Maybe this was the start of a lifelong habit of exactitude,
definitional clarity, and compulsiveness. But it may just have indicated that
back then, I was just a simple-minded little kid. My Uncle Pete Reinemeyer,
among others, never let me forget that story. The name saga continued when I
really did start school.

<p>I did not go back to school that year after the first day flunk out. The
extra year allowed time to mature somewhat and learn how to read. Mom always
encouraged us to read, and we usually received books for Christmas gifts. This
was a major advantage when I successfully started first grade in '42, and I
finished the year in a tie with Mickey Wulfhorst for top grades. Our teacher,
Sr. Pancratius told me that I would have been "highest boy" if I hadn't hit
Roger Wilhelm with a stone during recess in the spring of '43. St. John's
school and church were about one mile from our house, and there being no
family car, we walked to school every day.

<p>My parents had a 7th birthday party for me on New Year's Day of '43. It was
at my Aunt "Duchy's" house (dad's sister Lucille Miller). I was told that the
party wasn't at our own house because it was so small. All the boys in my
first grade section were there: Micky Wulfhorst, Zeno Post, Roger Wilhelm,
Tommy Weger, Tommy Ricker, Jimmy Ridenour, Hubey Warnecke, and Kenny Siefker.
One of the poorest kids, George Schabbing, did not attend. I'm not sure if he
was invited or not. He was considered to be a not very "nice" boy, and he also
usually stunk to high heaven. He either wet his pants, never bathed, or both.
We called him "Sweater-Boy," because he wore 3 or 4 sweaters at one time when
it was cold. Maybe they couldn't afford to buy him a winter coat. In any
event, the future would bring me more than a few conflicts with George.

<p>Some other memorable sensations include those of disagreeable tastes, as
well as some very pleasant odors. We did not have a refrigerator at the time,
and I can still remember taking milk for lunch in my thermos bottle. After
discovering the milk to be sour a few times, I refused to drink any milk at
all for many years. But the wonderful aroma of freshly baked bread lingers in
my senses. One of our neighbors baked bread, and I enjoyed eating it with hot
tea. My heightened sense of smell is probably inherited. Most of the family
had it, except for Aunt Aggie - Mom's older sister, Agnes Ditto. As mom
described it, "Aggie just didn't smell very good."

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">West Fourth St. 1943-44 -- 2nd grade</h1>

<p>Things were apparently getting out of hand with the crowd at Grandma's
house, and during the summer of '43, we moved. This time was to a tiny little
house not too far from Grandma's. We were close to the swimming pool, and I
spent a lot of time getting sunburned and learning how to swim. There were no
swimming lessons available, so everyone just taught themselves. That summer, I
came close to drowning when I went out over my head toward the deep area. I
was too embarrassed to yell for help, and luckily, my rudimentary dog paddling
saved me.

<p>Everyone was gung-ho for The War back then, and "Victory gardens" were
popular. We did our share with a huge garden and potato patch in the back
yard. My dad quartered the potatoes, and we dug the holes and dropped them in.
I tried growing a watermelon for myself, but ended up with only a tiny one.

<p>Summer sensory memories recalled are the taste of my mom's great home-made
iced tea, with fruit floating in it. She was not an accomplished cook, but
made some first class deserts - bread pudding, rice pudding, tapioca, and
pineapple upside down cake were her specialties.

<p>One memory of unpleasant sensations from back then is the odor of raw
sewage. During that year, our toilet backed up - it wasn't my fault! The sewer
pipes were ancient, cracked, and we were all up s--t creek, with around 4
inches of raw sewage covering the floor of the entire house. What a mess!

<p>Speaking of odors, one of our neighbors on Fourth Street were the
Schabbings. My classmate George had failed the first grade and was one year
older. He picked on me a lot, and made fun of my name. He and some of the
other not-so-nice boys would call me "Moron" or "Maur-ass." The name was a
burden for a little kid. But it may have worked like Johnny Cash's "A Boy Named
Sue," a song about a kid who was beaten up all the time because of his strange
name. But he compensated for it, and eventually became a very good fighter and
was able to survive. Maybe I compensated for being called "Moron" by working
extra hard to do well in school.

<p>George also beat me up regularly after school. Mom finally told me to
defend myself, and not to come beat up and dirty, and getting my clothes
ruined. This was a good idea, if for no other reason that George's stench was
so bad, it was terrible to smell him when he had me down and was punching me.
Some of my pals also helped me out, and we would often chase him home after
school. This exercise may have helped develop his endurance as a sprinter. On
the last day of school, he ran all the way home to tell my mom that I was
"highest boy" academically in the second grade. Sr. Leonardo apparently liked
me.

<p>A highlight of second grade was First Communion. First confession was one
week before, and I worried about telling all of my sins. (I was 8 years old).
After first communion, I then worried that I might have committed a sacrilege
because I had not confessed all of the mortal sins. (Did this experience screw
me up psychologically?) The first communion ceremony itself was traumatic
enough -- the boys wore short white pants, and long white hose held up by a
garter belt. My partner during the mass was Tommy Ricker, another future
fighting partner. Before we went into church, he whispered to me, quite
seriously and piously, recognizing the enormity of the day ritual: "Here we
go -- This is it!" That afternoon, we had a huge party for me at home. There
were many drunken people, including both of my parents.

<p>The second grade also brought a new classmate who became a lifelong friend
- Bob Holden, who moved to Delphos from Indianapolis in '43. He was quite
popular and was considered hot stuff, possibly because he had already made his
first confession and communion. He received every day, almost a whole year
before any of us. I am not sure how often he went to confession, but I suspect
frequently.

<p>In spite of all of our prayers, and even with God on our side, THE WAR was
continuing. I really missed my four uncles. I enjoyed climbing trees and up
onto rooftops, and one evening climbed up on the roof at home and cried while
I was thinking about the war. This was not unusual, since some people accused
me of being a "crybaby" at the time.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">Canal Street. 1944-49. 3rd Grade -- 7th Grade</h1>

<p>(Third-fourth grades, '44, '45, '46):

<p>During the summer of '44, we moved away from the Demon Toilet on West 4th
St. This time it was to Canal Street, between 2nd and 3rd streets. It was
closer to downtown Delphos than our previous Canal Street house. The street's
name was appropriate -- it was a mere 100 yards away from the Miami and Erie
Canal, which runs through the center of town.

<p>Ours was an interesting neighborhood, with lots of attractions. It was only
a one block walk for my Dad to his job at Schmidt's West Side Grocery Store.
He had awful foot problems -- painful bunions and callouses, and flat feet. The
feet and hypertension had kept him out of military service. But two Schmidt
boys, Jerome and Alfred did go into the Army, leaving Dad and 19 year old Bob
Schmidt to run the store for three years.

<p>Across the street from the house was Raabe's Ford. Since no new civilian
cars were made between 1941-45 because of The War, they sold only used cars.
Two doors down from us was the telephone company, and the nice looking young
lady telephone operators would walk past our front door. Adjacent to our back
yard was Harder's Funeral Home. Across the street from the telephone office
was the town bowling alley, site of my first paying job. Across from it was
Dr. Scherger's office, a G.P. who had gone to Xavier University and then St.
Louis U. Medical School.

<p>Across the street from him was a veterinarian's office, Dr. Lehman. One day
I say him cut open a female pig and remove the baby pigs? a Cesarean
Section. He did not sew up the sow, and it obviously died. I never quite
figured that one out.

<p>Our next door neighbors were Kahle's on one side, and the Swartz's on the
other. Marc Kahle ran a bakery in Delphos. He was a nice enough guy, but did
not give us any free cookies, pies, or creme puffs. Carol Kahle was his pretty
daughter, and one of my first girl friends, but "pal" Mike Wulfhorst came
around to "play" , and was a serious competitor. But the Kahles moved to
Toledo, and that ended my budding romance. The Swartz's were an old man and
woman who lived together. Story had it that they were not married, but I never
quite understood the relationship. They were mean to kids -- we were not allowed
to walk on the sidewalk in front of their house! What was wrong with all of
these Old Farts!

<p>Next to the Swartzes were the Fetzers, a large family of pretty good
people. Orby Fetzer was a classmate and we were big buddies, and his brother
Wayne was my sister's age. We all had some great times together, and often
went fishing in the canal. My mom's favorite of the family was little Paulie.
At age 3, he would entertain with his salty language, like calling someone a
"dirty backud" (bastard).

<p>There was an empty lot across the street, big enough for softball and
football, and kids from other neighborhoods came over to play. At the end of
the lot were tunnels under the sidewalk which made it great for our war games.
We played army, air force, and navy. I dreamed of being a navy or air force
pilot, and weirdly hoped that the war lasted long enough for us to get into
it. Fortunately, it didn't.

<p>The summer of '45 brought a glorious V-J Day and the end to World War II. I
was 9 years old, and celebrated by sneaking out two cans of beer and drinking
them in the huge cardboard box which served as my play
airplane-destroyer-tank-bunker. The beer tasted bitter, but I slugged it down
in the spirit of celebration, imitating adults who did the same thing when
they were happy about important events.

<p>My four Uncles came home from the army soon after. Favorite Uncle Tom
appeared one day in his officer's uniform, and had been doing a lot of
celebrating. But it was still good to see him and he brought me his old-style
battle helmet, a knapsack, a holster, and a cartage belt.

<p>Uncle Tom was instrumental in my development as a boxer. At the time The
War ended, I was still not defending myself too well, maybe even somewhat
sissified. In 3rd and 4th grade, the nuns at St.John's made a big deal of the
Saints and martyrs. They encouraged vocations to the priesthood, and at one
point, I thought a lot about going to the seminary. The martyrs were my
heroes, so that when some kid had me down and was beating the hell out of me,
I would "offer it up to God" like the martyrs, and take it. Wisely, my parents
did not think this was a great idea, and they gave me boxing gloves for a
Christmas gift.

<p>Uncle Tom was sparring with me, and gave me a jab in the nose. My nose was
always very sensitive, and when I got hit there, I would then usually lose
control and really start swinging my fists at whomever was in front of me. At
a Knights of Columbus picnic, I was in a boxing match. I was mostly just
dancing around until my opponent hit me in the nose. I lost control, and
really started swing away. They finally had to pull me off before I really
hurt him. ((This would be the first of many other childhood scraps)), but I
was very much into boxing at the time. I enjoyed practicing on my punching bag
at home. I was finally defending myself.

<p>Maybe too much self defense. For some reason, I got into a lot of fights
during 4th and 5th grade, mainly with Orby Fetzer and my first communion
partner Tom Ricker. This was mostly wrestling and body punching, as it hurt
too much to punch someone in the face without the cushion of boxing gloves.
Tom and I would sometimes have continuous fights over several days at a time.
One of the last ones was at a basketball game. We fought in public right
inside the school, before the game, at halftime, and afterwards. This was to
be one of my last fights, and it must have terribly embarrassed my Dad who
attended the game and watched me perform.

<p>Grandma Reinemeyer had a debilitating stroke in 1946, and moved in with us so
my mom could take care of her. Grandma was confined to bed most of the time,
could barely walk with help, had slurred speech, was incontinent, and stayed
in my parent's bedroom. She was still not too likable, and I sometimes
resented her for being there. I especially did not like it when she was given
the last doughnut that would have ordinarily been mine to eat.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">1947: 5th Grade</h1>

<p>Grandma died in 1947 when I was in the 5th grade. One morning my mom took
in breakfast as usual, and found her unresponsive. I knew she had died when my
mom screamed "Mom!" Grandma's death marked the time of a drastic change in my
attitude and performance in school. I was just learning to serve mass, having
memorized most of the Latin responses. It seemed natural for me to be a server
at Grandma's funeral. Up to that time, I had never missed a day in 5 years of
school. For some reason, my fifth grade nun counted me absent from school for
the entire day, even though I had missed only morning class for the funeral
mass. This may have been one of the beginnings of my "very long memory," in
which I never forget getting the shaft. I not only did not forget this, but it
changed my attitude toward school -- I soon became discouraged, and lost a lot
of interest.

<p>Although not spending a great deal of time on school work back then, I did
compose my first letter to an editor. The "Safety Legion" company made school
clothes for boys, such as corduroy pants and coats. They emphasized safety in
traffic and other life situations, and published a monthly magazine, "The
Pilot." The magazine featured letters and stories about events related to
various safety features. I sent in a story about a neighbor women, Emma
Metzger, who had become permanently "hunch-backed" from being hit in the back
with a snowball containing a large rock. Fortunately, the story was not
published, and I discovered later that the entire sequence of events had been
fabricated by one of our gossipy neighbors.

<p>Our family summer vacations during 5th-8th grades were spent in Detroit.
The four of us would take the base, staying with Aunt Mary, Uncle Fay, and the
5 Meekins kids in their tiny house in River Rouge, Michigan. My dad and I
would go to the Tigers' games every day, and we got to see stars like the
Yankees' Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle, and Yogi Berra, and my favorite, Ted
Williams of the Red Sox.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">6th-7th Grade</h1>

<p>In 1948-49, I was busy with the Boy Scouts and sports. During this time, at
age 11, several of us started going to boy scout meetings. I loved the scouts,
even when we got soaked with rain on our first camp out at Cascade Park,
around 30 miles from home. I had several tents, and usually had one set up in
our front yard all summer long, where we would sleep out frequently. "We"
included Barney Altman and Dan Maloney. Troop 48 had a very progressive
scoutmaster, Ted Grewe, who kept saying that the age for becoming scouts was
going to be lowered from age 12 to 11. This did not happen while I was 11. But
I was very much into the scouts, and at age 11, 1947, received an award. This
was Jack London's book "Call of the Wild," given for most rapid advancement in
rank. I went from tenderfoot to first class at age 11, too young to be a boy
scout at that time.

<p>In the 8th grade, I made Life Scout, with 18 merit badges, 3 short of Eagle
rank, needing Camping, Pioneering, and Bird Study. Some of the merit badges I
earned were Swimming, Life Saving, Athletics, Personal Health, Public Health,
First Aid, Pathfinding, Cooking, Photography, Safety, Pathfinding, Reading,
Scholarship. I'm not sure how I got the Pathfinding badge, since my sense of
direction was just as bad back then as it is now.

<p>Every summer for four years, our troop went to Shawnee Camp in Defiance,
Ohio. Canoeing was especially fun, and the first few years at camp were very
wholesome. But the last year, was not too scout-like. By that time, we were
smoking a lot, and the Maloney boys even brought a fifth of whiskey and buried
it in the ground inside our tent. It was not too unusual to skip swimming and
play poker and smoke all afternoon. Unfortunately, we were caught smoking, and
our troop was not allowed to have a candidate for the coveted Order of the
Arrow award, which I was hoping to get. My bad feet were keeping me from doing
a lot of long-distance hiking at the time, and I even had to bring callous
plasters for them.

<p>During this last year, the guys in our troop made friends with some black
scouts from Lima who were good guys, and especially knowledgeable about snake
lore. There were no black families in Delphos then, but we could not
understand why they were not permitted to go to the swimming pool in
Defiance -- it did not seem very scout-like.

<p>Our "gang" at the time -- Barney Altman, Dan Maloney, Mike Wulforst, Bill
Marquard -- also did some very unscoutmanship stuff. After troop meetings in the
fall, we would sometimes go "halloweening." A lot of this was mean and
destructive, like throwing tomatoes at front porches, pitching garbage cans
onto porches, kicking cabbages out of gardens like footballs, and pushing over
an outhouse. I really felt bad about doing all of this, especially the
outhouse caper. I worried that the old women who had the outhouse would go out
in the middle of the night, not see the hole, and fall into the cesspool and
drown in poop. Luckily for her and us, someone was nice enough to put the
outhouse back where it belonged. Unluckily for me, this violent behavior would
come back to haunt me in future years - what goes around comes around.

<p>Other boy scout activities included skinny dipping at "Bare Butt Beach" and
at the abandoned stone quarry near Grandma Reinemeyer's old house. The quarry
contained a huge swimming hole, roughly 200 yards across, and around 90 feet
deep. A bunch of us even went there at night one time. The trip out to the
quarry was often exciting. Our hangout, the "Chew-Chew Inn" was next to the
Nickle Plate Railroad. In the springtime we would hop the train when it was
moving slowly through town, and then jump off as it went past the quarry. At
that point, the train was starting to pick up steam, and if we did not get
off, the next stop was 50 miles away, in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. My parents were
never aware of our train-hopping activities.

<p>One of my last overnight scouting trips was to Stallkamp's Woods near
Delphos. Our adult leaders had left early, and for some reason, someone was
chasing a goofy kid, "Popeye" Warnecke. He climbed up one of the tall pine
trees and wouldn't come down. So some other "scouts" chopped the tree down
with Popeye in it. This looked like great fun, so the rest of us also chopped
down a bunch of trees. We did not get a merit badge for this. In fact, when
our troop chaplain, Fr. Ottenweller (Later Bishop of Steubenville) came out to
The Woods, he really chewed us out, and things were never quite the same for
Troop 48.

<p>During the Scouting Years, we hitch-hiked a lot, most often to Lima, for
various reasons. We usually went in 2s or 3s, and generally had no fear of any
violence. This activity gave me some "valuable" experience for future travel.

<p>I was a big sports nut. My Dad and I sat up late every night talking about
sports of all sorts. During the summer, baseball was the main interest. We
followed the Cleveland Indians closely, as well as home run races of Ralph
Kiner and Johnny Mize. I was allowed to have 1 or 2 beers, (age 11), depending
on whether Mom was still awake. Dad also took me to Jefferson football games,
where I learned to appreciate the aroma and taste of coffee.

<p>Football was a big attraction for me, and I thought I was pretty good at
it. Even though St. John's did not have football at the time, we played a lot
of sandlot ball. We were actually pretty good, our 8th grade St. John's team
playing the Jefferson junior high team to a tie in one game. I enjoyed it more
than basketball, and dreamed of playing football at Notre Dame, as a running
back. At one point, I considered transferring to Delphos Jefferson, just to
play football, but this idea was quickly vetoed by my parents. On Saturday
afternoons, I listened to Bill Stern broadcast the Notre Dame games, dreaming
to go there to play. This was before the TV era, at least in Delphos, Ohio.

<p>I never quite found a niche in track and field events. Although making the
elementary track team as a broad jumper, I did not do well in the one meet we
went to in the spring of '47. My old nemesis, George Schabbing was easily the
fastest kid in the class, and was to go in two events. We were to leave for
the event on a Saturday at 7 AM, but George never showed up. He said later
that he wasn't sure whether to be there at 7 AM or 7 PM, so he came at 7 PM.
We all joked about him being so dumb. Maybe he was just too poor to own an
alarm clock.

<p>In 6th grade, I was on the four boy shuttle relay team, but we did not get
past the prelims. In 7th grade, Barney Altman and I were to go in the 80 yard
low hurdles. But at the last minute, Coach Don Patthoff replaced me with Roger
Guise, who won the event. I did go as an alternate, but did not compete. There
would be future dealings and setbacks from Coach Patthoff. For my track
finale, I went as a high- jumper. Despite training diligently by not smoking
the week before the meet, I managed to finish 6th, just one place shy of
getting a ribbon. There were no individual trophies in those days.

<p>I enjoyed playing baseball and softball. In the 7th grade, there were
organized softball games in the AM, and baseball in the afternoon. I was an
awful hitter in baseball, getting only two hits the entire season, including
one home run. But softball was completely different. Apparently, I could see
the larger softball well enough to get a lot of hits. I finished second in the
league in batting with an average of .406, and managed two hits in our
All-Star game, including a triple.

<p>Basketball would be my main attraction for the next several years.In
1949-50, our junior high team was predominantly 7th graders -- Barney, Red
Elwer, Ronnie Wagner and I started the first game with Delphos Jefferson. I
did not last long as a starter, being very nervous during the games. This was
evidenced in my tendency to miss easy lay-up shots. Years later, I would blame
the nervousness on my life style -- not eating well-balanced meals, drinking
coffee, lack of sleep, smoking, and sometimes hangovers from booze. But Bill
Honingford would wisely dismiss these excuses as simply "a bunch of medical
reasons for being no damn good!" Patthoff was also our basketball coach, and
could often be heard yelling during practice: "Mueller! Stop that g-- d-----
dribbling!"

<p>A few years later, Patthoff became director of the "Delphos Youth Center."
As a somewhat smart ass freshman, I made the following remark to him:
"Patthoff, that's a nice looking tie -- it goes with your hair." Coach Patthoff
was very bald and did not appreciate these remarks. He gave me a very hard
slap in the face, saying "That's Coach Patthoff to you, Mueller!" The slap
probably helped, and I would be much less of a wise guy in the future.

<p>I have few memories of classroom activities during this time, but I did not
do well academically in 7th or 8th grade. One recollection is of Bob Holden
coming to school one day with glasses. He showed me how he could read the
blackboard from the back of the room. I said "What blackboard?" He let me try
the glasses on, and I could actually see writing on the board. I was badly
near-sighted, got my own glasses soon after, but did not wear them full time
until senior year. I was very self-conscious about it. The discovery of the
vision problem also provided a good medical explanation for my inability to
hit a baseball -- I just couldn't see it!

<p>The summer of '49 was awful. Because of the polio epidemic, the swimming
pool closed early, and the movie theatre, the "Capitol" also closed for one
month. Two friends developed bad cases of this dangerous disease. Donnie
Williams, my little preschool pal died. Neil Wilhelm, a great kid athlete one
year older than me, also was stricken. He survived after being in an iron lung
for several months, but both legs were paralyzed from the waist down. We would
carry him and his wheelchair up to our freshman biology class. All of this
occurred many years before polio vaccine became available in 1959.

<p>Many of my buddies had paper routes, but I never did get my own. I subbed
for some guys, went with them to collect, and helped pass the Sunday papers.
We folded them into a huge canvas bag, put the bag on our handle bars, and did
the route. One time, the bag was so heavy from the large Sunday edition, that
my handlebars turned around and dumped all of the papers into the snow. This
was all very frustrating.

<p>While we were living on Canal Street, when I was in the 6th grade, Sue was
dating a guy from Middlepoint. She was talking to him and some of his friends
in front of the house, and I thought I'd show them what a funny guy I was. At
the time, there was a popular song called "Feuding, Fussing, and a Fighting."
I sang the first line, but substituted the "F-word" for "Fussing." I did not
even know what the "F-word" meant. My sister was terribly embarrassed. The
guys thought it was pretty funny, but my parents did not. They thought I had
picked up the foul language from my neighborhood pal Wayne Fetzer, and forbad
me to associate with him. A few days later, my "mentor" and big brother figure
Barney Altman brought me up to date on the meaning of this forbidden word.

<p>During 6th grade at age 11, I was smoking with my cousin Frank Reinemeyer
when I was home alone. My parents kept a glass case full of cigs -- Pall Malls,
so it was easy to smoke. Did not inhale until 7th or 8th grade -- I was almost
always "in training" for some athletic activities.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">521 East Jackson Street</h1>

<p>Early in 1948, Grandpa Mueller died, apparently from some kind of "kidney
disease" which was treated with "Old Mister Boston" gin. Dad bought his house,
and we moved to Jackson Street later in the year. I remember some previous
overnight stays there, and especially some bouts of really bad bedbug bites
(fleabites). This was a very old house, complete with a barn -- not a garage,
which was having a hard time not falling over. My "gang" often hung out up in
the loft, mainly smoking and telling raunchy stories. We were very hard-up for
cigs, so used a cigarette roller, "recycling" old butts for more smoking
pleasure. My Mom was to be instrumental in getting me several jobs, the first
at the local bowling alley in the Fall of '48 -- 6th grade. She knew Louie
Rimer, owner of the local alleys. The work was hard, before automatic
pinsetting machines, and I worked several nights each week. It was good
exercise, especially when setting two alleys at one time. But I countered this
with my smoking on the job a lot. I was still getting into fights, such as
with Gene Siefker, a bigger and holder kid. One time, I hit him with an empty
wooden coke case -- no serious damage, since he took it with his head. At age
12, I had my Social Security card, but worked only until Christmas time. Two
priests from St.John's, Fr. Ottenweller, and Fr. Lemkuhl bowled in the KC
League on Wednesday nights, and I tried to keep them from seeing me. But they
apparently got to my folks, who realized that the job was interfering with my
school work -- I often did not get home until 1 AM. The work usually ended by
midnight, but we would usually stop at the Chew Chew Inn for burgers, fries,
and milk shakes. We would also blow a lot of our pay on the pin ball machine.

<p>My own first drunken party would be at the Jackson St. house. The occasion
was my folks' 25th wedding anniversary, and Barney and I got plastered on
beer. My Aunt Katy made Barney drink lots of milk, and he barfed all over the
place.

<p>In '49, St. John's won the state championship in basketball; our junior
high team "vowed" to do the same, and would almost pull it off in '54.

<p>EIGHTH GRADE - '49-'50. Basketball dominated my life. Our new basketball
coach was Frank Sowecke, who had coached all-American and Heisman Trophy
winner Vic Janowicz at Elyria high School. Unlike my other coaches, Sowecke
liked me, and I started several games for our junior high basketball team. I
did fairly well on defense, getting a lot of steals, but often ended the play
by missing the lay-up shot.

<p>A new friend, William (Mopey) Gillon arrived from Indiana that year. His
parents were very friendly, seemed to be well-off, and they had one of the
first TVs in town. Mopey was a very bright guy with a college-level
vocabulary, but like most of us, didn't do that well in school. I may have
"taught"him to smoke and drink, and this would return to haunt both of us. He
would later be the only team manager to ever get kicked off the team for
smoking, and would eventually die an alcoholic death.

<p>By the 8th grade, I was smoking regularly, inhaling every puff, and also
shaving my mustache twice weekly. I was maturing fairly quickly, but social
skills were not keeping pace. At a class dance, cousin Dan Maloney got out of
the partners lineup, and I ended up paired with Nancy (Moe) Murray, one of the
least attractive and most repulsive girls in the class. Dan ran out of the
dance, and I followed him. Nancy left in tears, and I eventually felt very
badly for her. I had always been a very shy kid, and this episode may have set
my social clock back by at least two years.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">High School</h1>

<p>When freshman year started, I also began my first regular job, as stock boy
and sometimes salesman at The Lion Clothing Store. My boss was Dewey Steinle,
the first of a long line of silver-haired father figures. (See my letter to
Jim Steinle))

<p>Another mentor entered my life during that year --  Fr. Ed Herr, St. John's
principle. He would be a constant stimulus and guidance for many years to
come. He gave a lot of good advice, and got me started in good reading habits.
He encourage me to take the pre-college course, aiming eventually for pre-med.
I really enjoyed biology, but got only B's in it -- never studied. My sister,
then a senior, was also in the class, but we did not really speak to each
other that much, and never discussed biology class. I was apparently kind of a
rebel, once wearing a full uniform of army fatigues to school.

<p>The Korean War was raging. Like a lot of the kids my age who remembered WW
II, I was very gun-ho at the time, hoping the conflict would last long enough
for me to get into it. Lucky for me, it ended during my junior year, and I
would quickly lose my interest in the military with future exposure to ROTC
courses at XU. Later, reading David Halberstam's history of the war, "The
Coldest Winter", I realized just how awful that war really was, and how lucky
I was to miss it.

<p>As a freshman, I played JV basketball, but didn't get in many games. My big
supporter Coach Sowecke had been fired, and replaced by Bob Arnzen, who was
not especially impressed by my style. I didn't even get into the first
freshman tournament game at Lima, and we were beaten out in the first game.

<p>During freshman year, the gang (Barney, Red, Mike, Holden, Butch Granger,
Dan Maloney, Mopey) often played "slips" at night, an elaborate form of hide
and seek. The last time we played, the cops caught some of the guys in a
freight car, and took us all down to jail for trespassing. They threatened to
lock us up. But Chief of Police Sam Link left us off with a warning never to
walk in any alleys in Delphos, during our entire lifetimes. Sam was not well
educated, as seen in the following story. He arrested a guy for disorderly
conduct. The judge asked if the man was drugged. Sam answered: "Hell yes, he
wouldn't walk, so I drugged him all the way to the station."

<p>In the summer of 1951, I was in an auto accident with Percy Lemkuhle,
grandson of the Delphos mayor, John Lemkuhle. On a rainy Friday the 13th, we
got Johnny (Governor) Bricker to buy 2 cases of beer and a fifth of whiskey,
and sped off in Percy's souped-up heap. But even before we had anything to
drink, Percy missed a curve on the way to Ottoville, hitting a telephone pole
and ending up in a ditch. Luckily, injuries were minor -- Bob Holden needed some
stitches in the head, and we all had some minor aches. But our main concern
was getting rid of the "evidence": 24 broken beer bottles. I was physically
uninjured, but two weeks later in a ride with Percy, I shook like a leaf
during the entire half mile trip to the pool. He was as reckless as ever, and
I never rode with him again.

<p>In sophomore year, basketball continued as my main interest. I again made
the JV team, but still wasn't playing much. After the first few games, Barney,
Red, Mike, and I were kicked off the team for 3 games for smoking. I had not
been caught, but did admit to smoking at our team meeting with Fr. Herr. A few
weeks later, Barney, Red, Holden, and Louie Bockey were kicked off for the
rest of the season, having been reported by some snitch. Although these guys
knew I also was still smoking, they told me to deny it to Fr. Herr. This
seemed to be good advice, since I would most likely never play again if I got
kicked off for the year. And I figured it would probably give me a chance to
show Arnzen my stuff, which as it turned out, was not that much, So I stayed
on the team. But the lie lingered in my conscience, and many years later, I
confessed it Fr. Herr, who good-naturedly bugged me about it. I did get the
chance to play regularly that year as a starter on the JV team. My high game
was 16 points against Fr. Jennings, despite playing the entire second half
with a nasal packing, after taking an elbow to the face in the first half. My
dad was very concerned about my smoking, and made me promise not to smoke
while I was on the team. I tried very hard to quit smoking, but had a severe
nicotine addiction. I felt bad about deceiving him about this, but couldn't
help it.

<p>Also that year, Sue got married, and I was best man. Surprising everyone, I
actually stayed sober at the reception. Maybe I was ill or something.

<p>Junior year, I had my first regular girlfriend - classmate Mary Ann Etgen.
We went steady for 6 months, but I broke it off on Valentine's Day, 1953. I
had become smitten by Sandy Stallkamp, a very nice babe living in Lima. But
dating her was tough since I had no car. That year, I struggled with Chemistry
classes getting mostly C's, probably from minimal studying. At one point, Fr.
Herr warned me that I would not have to worry about medical school, since with
those grades, I would not get even get into college. That year I also took a
required typing course. The class was hilarious, since I was sitting between
Butch Granger and Ronnie Yoakem, two of the funniest guys in school. I did not
do too well, especially after accidentally knocking my typewriter off the
desk.

<p>I was on the varsity basketball team as a rarely-playing sub, but got 6
points in the New Knoxville game. In this "finest hour" of my varsity career,
I hit a crazy hook shot from the key, and also purposely missed a free throw
in the final seconds. This last effort allowed Bob Kill to tip in a field
goal, giving us 100 points for the first time. Unfortunately, no one but Bob
believes I deliberately missed that foul shot.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">July 15, 1953: My Dad Dies</h1>

<p>Dad developed a strangulated hernia with a bowel obstruction, needed
emergency surgery at Lima St. Ritas, and had a heart attack during the
procedure That night, while sedated, he raised his hands and smiled, like he
knew where he was going - maybe a near death experience. Dad died the next
day. He was in very bad shape with severe hypertension, an enlarged heart, and
was very heavy -- weighed 220 at 5'6'', wearing size 44 short stout suits. Like
most men in those days, he never saw a doctor. We were crushed by his death,
and my life changed forever. I got lots of support at the time from Fr. Herr
and my Uncle Charles Reinemeyer, who described Dad as someone with a lot of
character. I missed him terribly, and still think of him often. He was a truly
a great guy, very friendly, had a wonderful sense of humor, and was religious
in a quiet way. He would make daily visits to church on the way home from
work. Years later,talking to Bob Holden about Dad, I was wondering what he was
praying for. Bob said, without hesitation, "He was praying for you, you jerk!"
Without doubt, the way my life was going, I really needed the prayers!

<p>I probably disappointed Dad a lot, with smoking, being a jerk, etc. We did
not have many father-son talks, but at one during my freshman year, we sat
down for a session on the "facts of life." He started off saying "You probably
know more about this than I do." That's all I remember of the chat. I often
wonder how things would have turned out if he had lived longer -- would I have
worked as hard as to get into medicine? With more funds available, would I
have partied and drank more?

<p>Mom bravely went back to work at age 45, as an RN at Lima St. Rita's, on
the 3-11 shift. She had not worked since the end of WW II in 1945, and it was
tough for her going back. But she liked nursing, and it helped with the
finances. She missed Dad terribly, brought in some money, and it kept her
busy.

<p>The Korean War ended July 27, 1953. Growing up during World War II, I had
been a gung-ho hawk, and was actually hoping the War would last long enough
for me to get into and be a hero like the marines at Iwo Jima. I also wanted
to get some GI Bill money for college.

<p>Beginning senior year, I went out for the basketball team, knowing Dad
would have wanted me to play. I even managed to quit smoking briefly, but
after a few practice games, it became obvious that I would not play much, so I
quit. The team went to the state finals and lost by 4 points. Bob Holden also
quit, and we always claimed that St. John's would have won the state title
with us on the team. (An obvious joke)! I concentrated on school work that
year, and for the first time in high school, actually took books home.
Although studying of any kind was frowned upon by my classmates, I needed to
really hit the books if I was going to get into medicine.

<p>Despite the new emphasis on studies, there were a few memorable parties,
such as one on New Year's Eve 1953, at Mopey Gillon's. His parents were away
for the holiday, and he would be staying at my house. We started the night in
a hurry, with Butch Granger and Bill Honingford getting very drunk very
quickly. I got a message that my flame Sandy Stallkamp had called from Lima to
wish me a Happy New Year. Her call saved me from getting drunk, but some of my
buddies were not so lucky. After I went home to return Sandy's call, Holden
called from Gillon's to tell me that Honingford had locked himself in the
bathroom at Mopey's house, and was vomiting all over the place. I went over,
talked him out, we cleaned up the place, and my Mom insisted that everyone go
back to my house. She promised not to "squeal" to Gillon's parents about the
drunken party,. Mom did insist on all of us going to the 7 AM New Years Day
mass at St. John's, which was being said in memory of my Dad's birthday. I
wonder what Fr. Herr thought when he saw all of us sitting out there,
bleary-eyed but barely being kept awake by the awful hangovers we all had from
the night before.. Mopey's parents later discovered a small quantity of
Honingford's barf on the bathroom window sill, so they found out anyway.
Looking back on OUR BIG PARTY brings out memories of our attitudes and
behavior at the time. First: the only drugs we could get were bourbon, beer,
and nicotine - no illegal substances available at the time. As far as I know,
there were no women present at the party - Fr. Herr always dictated: boys play
with boys, girls play with girls. I will always appreciate the loyalty and
friendship of my pals in getting up early and going to my Dad's mass.

<p>In the spring of '54, I got a half-tuition scholarship at Xavier University
for freshman year, and Red Elwer was being recruited for a full athletic
scholarship at XU. I always suspected that Fr. Herr might have made some kind
of a deal whereby Red would agree to go to XU if I were also given a
scholarship. Or maybe Red went there to help me out. I applied to only 2
colleges - Dayton and XU, but never visited XU before I started there in the
fall of '54.

<p>Every year, St. Johns seniors presented a class play, produced and directed
by Fr. Herr, who bragged about his M.A. in English from Columbia U. Our
production was "Rose Marie," and Barney Altman and I "competed" for the role
of Royal Canadian Mounty Sgt. Malone. Even though Rose Fast, the Musical
Director kept raving about my "great voice," Barney got the part. I did play
Sgt. Mulroney, and for awhile was going to sing a solo of "Here Comes the
Mounties." But Fr. Herr kept cutting the piece, getting down to me solo
singing only one sentence -- He said I was shouting instead of singing. It
seemed ridiculous, so I finally begged off singing any solo parts. I did do a
somewhat out of place waltz with Lois Richey, the female lead, and we were
given a nice write-up in the Delphos Herald. Some people had recognized my
dancing skills.

<p>In the summer of '54, I worked at Davidson Enamel Co. commuting to Lima
with Dan Maloney. I made the mistake of working too fast, apparently giving
the appearance of loafing, so I was fired after only 2 weeks. I desperately
needed money for college, and fortunately Dewey Steinle took me back at The
Lion for the summer. Both Dewey and Mayme were extremely supportive, and it
would not be until later that I would fully appreciate how much they had
really helped. They were very kind, wise, fun, and wonderful role models, as
well as extremely patient-they put up with me for 6 years. Without their
continuing support, I may not have made it through college. During high
school, Dewey gave me a raise, from $0.50, to $1.25 per hour, matching a job
offer I had from neighbor Tom Bendele as a carpenter's helper. I suspected
that Mayme influenced Dewey on this, perhaps concerned that I might ruin my
future-doctor's fingers with a hammer or saw. He also made a few "adjustments"
on my income tax returns, allowing me to save some much-needed money for
school. Mayme was always very encouraging, and was worried about my
psychological and social needs. Once she gave me $25 for a dinner date, to get
out and relax. Later, she said "You didn't use it for a date, did you?" I
admitted that I really wanted to, but needed the cash for food for myself.

<p>In July, I received an appointment to the Naval Academy from our
congressman William McCulloch. I had always dreamed of going to Annapolis, and
thought I could get a "free" college education, do my time in the Navy, then
go to medical school. I had several physical exams, but could not get a waiver
for my vision, and so never made it as a midshipman. But I had acquired some
pretty good political pull -- I would later use McCulloch's name as a reference
for medical school and Ob/Gyn residency applications, as well as helping me
get out of an assignment to Yokosuka Japan after finishing my residency in
'68. I had also written to him in 1955, complaining about nuclear
proliferation.

<p>Toward the end of the summer, word came out that my two best friends, Bob
Holden and Mike Wulfhorst, were going to the seminary. This was a surprise,
and for awhile, I toyed with the idea of going myself - being a Trappist monk
looked somewhat appealing. When I talked to Mom about this, she wisely told me
it didn't seem like a very good idea, especially with my scholarship. Fr. Herr
agreed, but suggested that I take some Latin courses at XU while I was still
considering it. Fortunately, by the time school started, I had pretty much
eliminated the priesthood as a viable career alternative. 

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">An Introduction To "Higher" Education</h1>

<p>--PREMED AT XAVIER UNIVERSITY

<p>In September 1954, I was off to XU, with $950 in the bank. Our neighbor Tom
Bendele transported me and my stuff to Cincy in their old Kaiser sedan,
together with Mom and his wife and two kids. Mom did not return until
graduation. Although we all stayed in Elet Hall dorm, Red, Mopey and I pretty
much went our separate ways. Freshman year roommates were John Alwine, from
Greensburg PA, and Conrad Donakowski from Detroit. John was a psych. major and
big drinker, spending a great deal of time mourning about his girl friend who
had dumped him to enter the convent. Conrad was a fruity Honors AB student,
and didn't really fit in with us. He was replaced in the second semester by
Dave McDevitt, a business major from Louisville, a funny guy and similar to
John in habits. I was able to study fairly well most of the time, since the
roommates were either visiting other partiers and/or out drinking.

<p>Fr. Herr had warned me that the St.X boys would be academically far ahead
at the start, and I would need to really hit the books right off the bat -- they
were, and I did. Didn't go home until Thanksgiving vacation.

<p>I worked at the Lazurus Store in downtown Cincy for one month before
Christmas vacation, and was assigned in the outerwear department. An
embarrassing moment occurred when a customer asked me to model a jacket. I had
a huge hole in the back of my shirt, and had to wiggle around to face her, so
she wouldn't see it. The job wasn't very convenient, since I had to hitchhike
downtown to the store and take the bus back to school at night.

<p>After returning to school after Christmas, I was considering the
possibility of dropping out to go into the army, to be eligible for GI Bill
money for education. Since I was getting very low on funds after just one
semester, if I couldn't pay my way through freshman year, how could I ever
afford the next 3 years of premed and then 4 years of medical school? Fr.
Peters talked me out of going into the service, assuring me I was doing fine,
and that things would work out. He would be my second silver-haired
father-figure. I got XU Loans, but these were due within one year.
Fortunately, there wasn't much money left over for booze, and often months
would go by between beers. But my freshman year at XU ended with a drinking
spree with Red and Mopey at Skippers Bar, getting free beer, courtesy of the
visiting Carling's Black Label salesman. I would develop a lifetime weakness
for free booze, including future Navy wetting-down parties. Several of my XU
classmates would become life-long friends--Matt Gorham, from Nashville, Pete
Carroll, Toledo, Neil Mooney, Bristol TN, John King, a Gary IN native.

<p>In the summer of '55, jobs remained scarce, and Dewey took me back again at
The Lion. I was concerned that there might not be enough funds to start
Sophomore year, and Fr. Herr chewed me out for being moody and unfriendly. But
on his tip, I got a job with Collier Construction, which was putting up
high-tension towers, at $1.30 per hour. Also worked Saturdays at Lion. This
provided enough money at least for the first semester of sophomore year at XU.

<p>My second year "dorm" was old Elet Annex across from Elet Hall, with seven
other pre-med/dents. The house had dorm status, but no live-in prefect, since
the occupants were generally serious students. My assigned roommate was Chuck
Menk, an affluent physics major from Cleveland. He was weird, but did apply his
science background to rewire The Annex pay phone so that we could make free
long-distance calls. But this lasted until the phone company discovered the
deception.

<p>During this year, I had courses in physics, quantitative analysis, logic,
metaphysics, and a second year of required ROTC. I enjoyed logic, but
metaphysics, taught by Dr. Gendreau, was a total mystery. Three St. X High
School grads dominated the metaphysics class -- none of us liked these guys,
since they seemed to actually understand the material. Knowing the exams would
be taken entirely from hand-outs, most of us just memorized the stuff, and
regurgitated it for tests. If nothing else, this sharpened my memorization
skills needed for medical school. Most of us hated ROTC, since it encroached
on the other subjects, and pretty much shot all day Friday, when we had
outside marching and inspections. This was to be the beginning of my lifetime
disgust for military inspections, which would be even worse during future Navy
years. I Worked in Fr. Peters' lab, that year and the next, feeding
salamanders and cleaning the cages. This was for half tuition, and
fortunately, my scholarship had been renewed, thanks to Fr. Herr.

<p>A great memory of that year was XU upsetting UC in the annual crosstown
football game. In our enthusiasm, we celebrated by tearing down the permanent
goal posts at UC, dragged them down Victory Parkway, and then hiding them in
the Annex yard. That night, we drank beer out of one of the goal post cups at
the Tally Ho bar. 

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">Campissed! The Shoe And The Beer Bottle</h1>

<p>One beautiful springtime Friday the 13th, we felt the need for some R&amp;R
at the Annex. Booze of any kind was forbidden in all dorms, but we proceeded
with our mini-Mardi Gras. When this fizzled, we checked out The Armory dance
next door. Meanwhile, Fr. Bob Liska, Elet Hall prefect, paid a surprise visit
and discovered one empty beer bottle and a lady's shoe. It seems that two
females had been given a perfectly innocent -- but prohibited -- "tour" of The
Annex. We were all campussed indefinitely, being allowed out only for classes.
I required special permission from Fr. Liska to go across campus to my job in
Fr. Peter's lab. It would be a long semester, or even worse, possibly a very
short one, since offenses like ours were reviewed by the unsympathetic
"Student Welfare Board." This tribunal was better known to us as the "Farewell
Board," because most offenders were expelled. We were all very anxious, as
expulsion could nix any possibility of medical school. Fortunately, Fr. Joe
Scharf, a dynamic young Jesuit, pleaded our case, and finally won. Just before
Easter, after 40 days and nights in confinement, we were pardoned. It may have
taught us some kind of lesson, but it without doubt soured me on dorm life.

<p>In the Summer of '56, jobs were still scarce. But Mom came through for me
once again by talking to Oscar Kolkmeyer, leading to work as a mortician's
assistant in the funeral home, and driving hearses and ambulances. There was
an extra $20 for me taking an ambulance to the Landeck stock-car races on
Friday nights. Red Elwer went along for company -- he had dropped out of XU and
planned to go into the army in the fall. At that time, I had only my Boy Scout
first aid background, and fortunately, there were no major accidents at the
racetrack. Apparently, I became smitten by the racing, and dumbly got the 1936
Cadillac hearse up to 100 mph for a first (and last) time at that speed, while
bringing flowers back from an Ottoville funeral. Thought it would be neat to
take the hearse to XU to bring my stuff back, but Oscar thought better of it,
and insisted on my taking his new Pontiac sedan instead. Oscar was a good guy,
and he qualified as another of my silver- haired father figures.

<p>Rebelling from the campusing incident at the Annex, Matt Gorham and I found
an off campus apartment at Mrs. Jacob Better's basement apartment, 1325
Victory Parkway. The location was ideal, being just across from campus and a
short walk to classes. Junior year I had Organic Chemistry, Comparative
Anatomy, Embryology, philosophy of man, and phil. of nature. It wasn't that I
had a great love of philosophy, but we were required to take 18 hours of
philosophy.

<p>One social highlight of junior year was a trip with the gang to Oxford for
a great football Saturday at Miami U. We went through lots of beer, and Bernie
Swaykus and Pete Carroll stole the large Toledo pennant from top of Miami
stadium, and took it back for display at the Annex. Oxford was on to the rowdy
XU boys, and all the bars in town were closed after the game.

<p>In October, I received the bad news that my old buddy Red Elwer had been
killed in an auto accident and went home to be pall barer at his funeral. He
was a great friend, but was kind of mixed-up and never could decide exactly
what he might want to do with his life.

<p>First semester of junior year was my best ever academically, surprising
myself with a 3.75 average, placing me in the top 10 of our class of 500.
Figuring that I could save an entire year's expenses by getting into medical
school after three years, I applied to Ohio State. At my interview there, the
two interviewers spent most of the time asking me how I was going to finance
my medical school education. They appeared to accept my assurance that my rich
Aunt Minnie Reinemeyer would back me up financially, if necessary. I had never
approached her on this, and have no idea whether she would have helped me out.
I did receive an alternate acceptance at OSU that year.

<p>However, I had heard nothing from OSU when senior year at XU was beginning,
so decided to stay on for my degree, save some money, but also have some fun.
I rounded out my philosophy requirements with two ethics courses. The prof for
both courses was Fr. Tom Curran, who prophetically wrote on one of my essays:
"Look for ways to get more involved in medical ethics." Also took several
science courses, including histology, physiology, and genetics, which would
help me in medical school. One funny incident in histology class - after an
exam, Jim Wiggs, a very bright guy from Indianapolis who would become a
neurologist, was also a great wit. We were complaining about a test slide of
cartilage tissue, which the instructor, Dr. Tafuri had insisted also contained
bony tissue. Wiggs remarked: "Tafuri turned that cartilage into an os penis
and screwed us with it."

<p>That last year turned out pretty well in many respects - the extra time
helped me mature both socially and academically, as well as saving a fair
amount of money. It was back to Mrs. Better's basement apartment, rooming with
brainy Bernie Swaykus from Steubenville. Matt Gorham was starting dental
school at St. Louis U. My new job at St. Francis Hospital lab would help me in
future medical school courses and jobs. Also learned how to hit veins and draw
blood. Bought my first car, actually our first family car -- a very beat-up '46
Chevy, purchased at Sheeter's Motors in Delphos, for $150, in January of 1958.
After hitchhiking home and everyplace else for 3 years, I no longer had to
thumb downtown, and then take a bus to St. Francis on the other side of town.
I sometimes had to drive to the hospital early in the AM to draw all the
morning blood for the lab. One icy cold morning in February, the brakes went
out on the way to work, and I stupidly continued the trip to the hospital with
no brakes.

<p>Foolishly, I applied to only two medical schools -- OSU and Loyola Chicago. I
figured that since I had an alternate acceptance at Ohio State the previous
year, I would most likely be accepted there. I brashly declined a Loyola
interview because of a big XU football weekend in Cincy. There was no further
word from Loyola, but fortunately, I did get accepted at OSU.

<p>Graduation from XU was in May, 1958, and I drove the heap to Delphos,
returning with Mom and Sue for the ceremonies. Good friend Neil Mooney invited
me to his party at a swank motel. Mom and Sue took a bus back to Delphos the
next day. That summer after graduation, I stayed in Cincy in a second floor
apartment across from St. Francis -- saved $$ on gas and housing. I shared the
place with Bob Howell, an effeminate Canadian RN. The subject of homosexuality
was not widely discussed back then, but in retrospect, Bob was probably gay.
Also, the apartment was just down the street from 3 girls who provided cheap
dates for the summer. At the end of the summer, I was working double shifts in
the lab, and was able to put away almost enough cash for the first two
quarters of medical school. This included the $150 I got from selling my
Chevy.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">Medical School -- Ohio State 1958 -- 1962</h1>

<p>The Alpha Kappa Kappa medical fraternity house would be my home for the
first three years, as it was only one block from school and because I had a
job in the kitchen there for my meals. Bob Dean, a classmate of my sister's
got me the job. I had known him as an Eagle Scout in old Troop 48. He was a
very bright and witty guy, an artist, and a musician, but also kind of a
dealer, selling me some shares in his side business of "Canned Ice." And
toward the end of the year, he borrowed $100 from me for graduation fees -- I
was "loaded" with extra cash from my government loans. Bob became a very
successful plastic surgeon, but never did repay the $100.

<p>My first roommate was Don Roman, an army vet and memorizer from Dayton, who
studied day and night, finally dropping out after freshman year. The last time
I saw him, he was pumping gas in Columbus. That first year was one of the
hardest of my life. Gross anatomy was especially tough, and I studied
extremely hard, barely getting by with C's, like most of the class. I used a
variety of study methods, including trying to sleep from 6 PM to midnight,
then studying all night. One week of this was enough, mainly because I
couldn't sleep during those hours. Spring Quarter was the worst academically,
especially Head and Neck Anatomy, which I barely passed with a D. (my only one
in Medical School). Forty-seven guys flunked it, and they had to repeat the
course in summer school at U Of Michigan. I'm not sure if I could have done
that, since I needed the summer to make enough money to at least start
Sophomore year.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">?The Last Fight</h1>

<p>One warm Friday spring night, Ed Casper and I needed a break from the books
and went to the Old Heidleberg for some liquid refreshment. On the way home,
some guy looked at me and shouted "F--- you!" Ed advised me to ignore him,
which I did, but a few minutes later out on the street, the jerk jumped me
from behind, hit me in the face and broke my glasses. We punched each other
around for awhile, and the cops finally came by and broke it up. After we got
back to the house, Ed told me I needed stitches, that the laceration had just
missed my eye. We went to the OSU ER, and I boisterously insisted on being
sutured by the plastic surgery resident. I was an attraction at our next
morning's class, having a big black eye with a huge bandage on my face. Was I
finally a kind of a war hero? Probably not.

<p>Toward the end of the year, I had a blind date with a Sophomore nursing
student, Kathy Reddy. My friend, Chuck Kayser fixed us up, with the enticement
that she was a big beer drinker from Cleveland. Chuck and I had several drinks
before picking up the girls and heading for another buddy's house, Ernie
Mazzaferri. It turned out that Kathy was not a beer drinker, and did not
suspect that I was already at least two sheets to the wind. But I really liked
her, and fortunately we did hit it off from the beginning, and planned to meet
again.

<p>A few weeks later, I went to Matt Gorham's wedding in Nashville. He asked
me to serve at the wedding mass when one acolyte didn't show up. But at the
reception, I had one of my most notorious drinking performances, getting drunk
on champagne and passing out in Matt's bedroom. Unfortunately, the bedroom was
going to be used as the gift room, and guests had to step over me to deposit
their wedding presents. I'm sure that Matt's mother got tired of saying "And
this is Matt's good friend from Xavier -- he's a medical student at Ohio State."
I finally woke up early in the evening, and proceeded to get drunk for the
second time in one day -- a first and last for me. I obviously needed some kind
of guidance and direction, at least some different sort of companionship!

<p>My luck would improve. The very next week, I saw Kathy again, and we
started dating steadily. She turned out to be the girl I had been looking
for -- beautiful, bright, built, bubbly, and with great social skills -- many
things which I lacked. She was very friendly, had a great smile, and laughed
at my jokes. I had a feeling that she would be a great wife and mother. By the
end of a great summer, we were "pinned" - a state of pre-engagement. These
proved to be the happiest times of my life, whether "studying" down by the
Scioto, going to OSU football, or just being together. We had great times, and
she made the drudgeries of medical school bearable.

<p>My full time summer job was at Grant Hospital lab, where I saved enough for
the first quarter of sophomore year. The year was also a tremendous grind,
with physiology, pathology, and pharmacology being the make or break courses.
I liked path and did well in it. But after getting a "D" in a tough physiology
exam, we were given the chance to take a make-up test to improve our grades.
At that time, the older fraternity brothers had a supply of amphetamines, and
these helped me pull an all-night cram session the night before the exam. I was
so hopped me up, I could see my heart beating through four layers of clothing.
Afterwards, I met up with Kathy. After babbling nonstop for 30 minutes, she
finally told me to shut up. I was obviously caffeine and
amphetamine-intoxicated.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">Clinical Years At OSU</h1>

<p>Junior year started in June of '60, with a rotation on general surgery. One
of my clinic patients had thrombophlebitis, and I saw her for daily rounds for
two weeks, doing leg exams and measurements. Before she went home, she gave me
a gift of a bandage scissors, which I continue to use. At the time, there were
no questions about the ethical aspects of accepting gifts from patients. I
fact, there was minimal discussion of any ethical aspects of anything. But I
would later use this case as an effective discussion topic in ethics sessions
on professionalism, for first year medical students at UC. I also did my first
bit of minor surgery, excising a cyst from the scalp of a women with multiple
cysts who came in every few months especially to have a medical student do the
surgery.

<p>Also during junior surgery was a rotation on the world-famous Dr. Robert
Zollinger's service. He was a brilliant but wild and eccentric man. There were
lots of stories of his abuse of surgical residents, but he treated students
much better -- actually more like pet dogs than anything else. One day on his
student rounds I presented an ulcer patient, the case of which I had memorized
cold. Half way through the presentation, he came up to me, unhooked my clip-on
bow tie, and said "You cheap son of a bitch!" We all laughed, but I continued
with the rest of the presentation. Zollinger then clipped the tie back on, and
took off.

<p>That summer, Kathy's dad Gil Reddy died of a heart attack. He was a really
good guy and I wish I could have known him better. My grandmother Helen
Mueller also died at the same time. The funerals were on the same day, and I
had to decide which funeral to attend. Using overwork as and excuse, I opted
out of either, and still feel bad about the decision. I probably should have
tried to go to both.

<p>Also that summer, I was introduced to some of the nitty gritty of medical
practice with a job as extern at Alum Crest Nursing Home in Columbus. My 3
months on junior surgery qualified me for the job. Working one night weekly, I
fortunately did not get many emergency calls. Mom had given me a "Merck
Manuel," and had written up a short list of medications which I might be
ordering, such as Seconal for sleep, and MOM and cascara for constipation. One
night I was called to see an epileptic patient having a seizure. The book
advised IV Phenobarbital, which I gave, and it worked. A few weeks later, the
same guy cut his hand, and I proudly put in my first stitches.

<p>I also continued my job at Grant Hospital Lab. Since I lived only one block
from school, I got by the first two years without a car, taking busses and
sometimes borrowing friend's cars. But Alum Crest was way across town, and
wheels were required. I was turned down for a car loan by my Delphos bank,
because I had no collateral. Years later I discovered that the bank loan
officer, Elmer Scherger, hated my Uncle Tom, and had also turned him down for
a loan in 1945 after he returned from WW II. Seems that Uncle Tom had rubbed
Elmer the wrong way on several occasions. I suspect that Elmer got even with
Tom through me. My old undertaker boss Oscar Kolkmeyer loaned me $700 for a
'54 Ford coup. When asked about loan payments, Oscar told me not to worry
about it. This would return to haunt me after he died, when his widow demanded
immediate total repayment, with interest. To pay off this loan, I had to get
another loan from Navy Federal Credit Union, which I finally repaid years
later. As it turned out, the car was no great bargain. It handled pretty well
under ordinary conditions, but less than ideal at weather extremes. The
inefficient heating system required adding cardboard for floorboard insulation
in the winter. And I managed to burn up the engine on a trip back from
Cleveland, neglecting to check the oil levels on a very hot day in July. It
took a week to get a rebuilt engine, and required several hitch-hiking trips
to the garage up in Marion, Ohio. This was during my junior year rotation on
surgery, and was extremely frustrating.

<p>Fall quarter of 1960, I was free from school, and was employed full time at
Alum Crest. There were around 100 patients in the Nursing Home hospital, and
three of us took turns "running" the hospital. It was depressing working with
the very old people, especially those who never had visitors. It was hard to
get rounds made, since many wanted to just chat. One memorable patient was a
man with a leg full of malignant melanoma. He was in a lot of pain, and the
lesions caused a very foul odor. We had to apply acetone to his leg, which
helped the odor, but hurt him a great deal. The epileptic patient whom I had
sutured also had MS, and he talked me into giving him an unconventional
treatment -- orinase. The medication was approved for diabetes, but he showed me
a JAMA article on using it for MS. It seemed to work for awhile, but,
eventually his blood sugars got too low, so we had to take him off of the
Orinase.

<p>The Alum Crest job presented a rich variety of cases, one being a woman
with severe ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). One time the night RN supervisor
complained about the patient's husband staying nights with this patient. The
nurse opined that it was terrible that he might actually be having sex with
his own wife. On another occasion, I attempted to catheterize the bladder of a
very old man with prostate disease. It was my toughest catheter job ever, and
was unable to get urine. After a few tries I realized that the catheter was
draining fecal-looking material. After several attempts, I called in a
urologist. He reassured me that I had not perforated the bladder, but instead,
the patient's diverticulitis had eroded into it, and the bladder was already
full of feces. Needless to say, the patient stayed much calmer than me
throughout our ordeal.

<p>Christmas, 1960 was a notable one -- Kathy and I got engaged! We spent
Christmas Eve in Delphos with my mom, and then drove up to Berea to spend the
day with Kathy's mom, a trip we would often repeat may times.

<p>Junior year resumed in January with my rotation on the medicine service. It
started on gastroenterology, doing sigmoidoscopies on each new patient. After
the first few, most of these were unsupervised. The dictum at the time was
"See one, do one, teach one" -- First, observe a procedure; next do one
yourself; a person was then "qualified to teach someone else the technique.
Also memorable was the rotation on cardiology, consisting mostly of patients
with severe rheumatic heart disease. They all died. This was before surgical
valve replacements, and way before heart transplants.

<p>The final stint of third year was pediatrics, which I greatly enjoyed. The
teaching proved especially good. My mentor, Dr. Ambuel noticed that I was
reluctant to hurt kids when I examined them. I seriously thought about peds as
a specialty, for the next few years, even considering pediatric surgery at one
point. But I really didn't want to take care of sick kids.

<p>Senior year in surgery amounted to very brief stays in surgical
subspecialties: ophthalmology, ENT, orthopedics, thoracic surgery, urology,
anesthesiology, and urology. Orthopedics was interesting, and I got to reduce
a dislocated thumb. But none of the other areas held my attention. While on
anesthesiology, I saw my first baby born, and this interested me more than the
anesthetic techniques.

<p>September 9, 1961: WEDDING BELLS RING in Berea, OH. Ernie Mazaferri stayed
sober as best man, but not my old buddy Mopey Gillon didn't. At the reception,
Mopey was seated across from Kathy's Aunt Helen Neihieser, and he impressed
her by barfing into his plate while the newlyweds were being toasted. We had a
great honeymoon in The Poconos -- a very staid place by itself. But met another
independent- thinking couple -- former XU guy and wife, and we spent a lot of
time with them. Our wedding took place with Uncle Sam's help via the Navy
Senior Medical Student Program. This involved getting Navy ensign's pay during
my senior year in medical school, in return for agreeing to serve 3 years on
active duty. I knew that one of these years would be spent at sea, but
believed it was worth it. Unlike later programs where the entire four years of
medical school could be underwritten by serving several years in the military,
this was the only available program at the time -- 1961. And it was a relatively
peaceful world, before the Cold War really heated up.

<p>During quarter off at Mercy Hospital I had a huge amount of surgical and ER
experience. One day I was first assistant for a craniotomy (brain operation)
for a brain tumor. This would have been unique by itself, but it was also the
very first brain surgery I had ever seen. Mercy's ER was also exciting. One
Saturday morning a woman known to have severe heart disease was brought in.
She was actually dead on arrival. But a neurosurgeon was passing through the
ER at the time, and told my fellow senior medical student Clarence Cotterman
to do an open heart massage. This involved opening the chest, exposing the
heart, and manually massaging the heart. The doctor assured us that this would
be good "practice" for us. Years later in the 90's, the idea of students
"practicing" on the newly dead would be a major ethical dilemma. But no one
talked much about ethics back then.

<p>I had not yet had an OB rotation, and there were very few deliveries at
Mercy. But the first vaginal delivery I ever saw, I did myself. I was lucky
enough to have three very good RNs talk me through it. One gave the patient
open drop ether, one scrubbed in with me, and the other looked over my
shoulder and told me exactly what to do. The patient had several prior
deliveries, so my primary job was to just catch the baby before it hit the
floor. Fortunately, mother and baby did just fine, and this was to be the
first of many episodes, where my luck prevailed, and I "came out smelling like
a rose."

<p>My night job at Mercy continued for the rest of the senior year. This was
mainly working the ER. During winter quarter while on the medical service at
OSU, a patient arrived in the early hours with severe congestive heart
failure. I applied the customary treatment, and the patient pulled through.
After this, I called Dr. Metzger, the attending internist, and then left for
school for my final oral exams in Medicine. I walked into the exam room to
find the same Dr. Metzger as my examiner. His comment: "Well, you certainly
know how to treat heart failure -- you get an "A" for this exam."

<p>The final rotation at OSU was on OB/GYN. I had only 7 deliveries, but I
enjoyed it and started thinking about a career in OB/Gyn. Also, Kathy was
pregnant with Laurie, and this gave a lot of incentive to learn as much OB as
possible. 

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">Internship: Mt. Carmel Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. 1962-63</h1>

<p>In those days, most of us took a rotating internship, splitting the year
into 4 months on medicine, 4 on surgery, and 2 each on Pediatrics and OB/Gyn.
My first stint was Medicine. The very first week, one of the patients on my
floor was a doctor on the Ohio State Medical Board. One day, he asked me to
grade some of the recently taken medical license exams. He had to know that I
had just taken the exams myself, and could possibly have graded my own paper.
So I declined.

<p>There was much valuable experience on the medical service. and it was
mostly non-stressful. But there were also lots of opportunities to do CPR. My
most memorable CPR adventure began on a quiet Sunday evening. There was an
emergency call about a man with cardiac problem who became confused and had
passed out on the landing between floors. When fellow intern Bob Caporal and I
reached him, he was ok, but we carried him back to his room. Returning to the
nurses station, Bob noticed that I had feces smeared all over my brand new
white buck shoes -- the patient had lost control and defecated all over the
place. The student nurse ran up and said "Oh Dr. Mueller, let me clean your
shoes." I said, that's ok, my wife will do that. But that's another story.
Exactly one week later, there was another emergency call on the same
patient -- this time he had a cardiac arrest. I tried to resuscitate him with
external cardiac message and several shocks with the defibrillator. After an
hour, the chief resident finally pulled me away -- he had without question died.
I talked with the family at length, and then was greeted by my buddy Caporal.
I was totally exhausted and down, and expected some words

<p>of encouragement. What I got from Bob was "Mueller, I always knew you were
a butthead. But anyone who electrocutes a person just for shitting on your
shoes, man that's just too much."

<p>The next rotation was OB, which started on November 1, 1962. Luckily, I was
off on Saturday, Nov. 3, when Kathy started having labor pains. She had
irregular contractions all day. At suppertime, they were still very irregular.
I did a rectal exam (standard practice for medical students at the time), and
there was no cervical dilatation (as far as I could tell). So we went ahead
and had a big steak dinner. This could have proved disastrous, but we lucked
out. Finally, we called her obstetrician, Dr. John Boutselis, who prescribed 2
Seconal. Kathy slept for several hours, and then woke up with strong regular
labor pains, so we went to the hospital. She was 9cm dilated on admission, and
we thought we barely made it on time. But the position was occiput posterior,
and Kathy needed to push for several hours. Finally, Laurie was entered the
world at around 5 AM on Nov 4. She had a very vigorous cry, which continued
more or less indefinitely, and which we would become very used to hearing.

<p>I really liked OB -- I had 65 deliveries, and being able to do the actual
work was energizing. The most memorable experience was a breech delivery. I
had seen the lady in our clinic several times, so she was sort of "my"
patient. Breech deliveries are always complicated -- first the butt and legs are
delivered, then the shoulders, and then the head. Each stage needs to be
managed correctly, otherwise there can be disaster. The resident told me to
read up on breech delivery technique, and then I could do the entire delivery
myself. Things went beautifully, and mother and baby did just fine. The whole
experience proved to be great, and was a definite impetus for my future in
Ob/Gyn. Early on, I had the definite feeling that whatever specialty I chose,
the work needed to be more or less fun. I found Ob/Gyn to be challenging, and
provided an opportunity to do some really good things with my life.

<p>But there were a few drawbacks. One of my deliveries involved a patient of
the notorious Dr. Pavey. It was said that he hated interns, and was rumored
that he never wanted an intern to deliver his patients -- he would rather have a
nurse do it - actually not a bad idea. At night, a labor patient of his
arrived, and the RN called me to see her. Knowing that Pavey would kill me
regardless of the circumstances, I reluctantly saw her. As it turned out, the
baby had 6 tight loops of cord around its neck. The condition was without
doubt preventing her from delivering, so I clamped and cut all 6 loops, and
did the delivery. The nurse told me this saved the baby's life. Fortunately, I
showed the cord to show Pavey, and sheepishly more or less apologized for
doing the delivery. He did not chew me out.

<p>Pediatrics at Children's Hospital Columbus was my next service. It was lots
of work, but great exposure. We were on call every other night, made somewhat
bearable with the humor of Ernie Mazzaferri and Bob Caporal, who shared my
call nights. Bob did things like addressing me as "Dr. Fink" in front of a
patient's parents. At another time, he said "You're not really going to let
this intern (me) take care of your child, are you?" That was before the
malpractice onslaught begin -- we could be pretty casual and careless when
talking to patients and families. I did have malpractice insurance, but the
premium was only $100 per year.

<p>One of the most grueling rotations at Children's was the Infectious ward,
mostly babies with croup or diarrhea. I would come home after my 36 hour
stint, stripping off my white coat, pants, and shirt for fumigation as soon as
I walked in the door, and jump in the shower. Laurie was only 2-3 months old,
and we didn't want her coming down with one of these dreadful illnesses. As it
was, she already was afflicted with the COLIC . The poor little thing would
cry all day and all night. I would generally get no sleep at Children's, and
then we tried to find some way to make Laurie comfortable so Kathy and I could
get a few hours sleep on the alternate nights I was home in our tiny three
room apartment (counting the kitchen). After trying every possible treatment,
one very wise doctor advised us to put Laurie in the portacrib in our little
bathroom and close the door so we wouldn't hear the screaming. We felt bad
about doing this, but it worked -- at least we didn't hear the crying). The
colic experience may also have influenced my decision not to go into
pediatrics. I not only didn't want to take care of sick kids, I didn't want to
take care of screaming ones.

<p>In December, I took my first plane ride, going to Washington DC to see the
Navy detailer to discuss my first assignment. My wish list went between west
and east coasts, wanting to be as far away from Cuba as possible. This was the
time of the Cuban missile crisis -- everyone was afraid of nuclear war with the
Soviet Union (Russia). As it turned out, my assignment would be Kingsville,
Texas, a place that very few enemies would want to capture.

<p>My last internship rotation was Surgery, beginning with ER. This was also
every other night work, but I enjoyed it. There is something special about
seeing an acute problem, making the diagnosis, and applying the appropriate
treatment. I diagnosed a ruptured spleen, a ruptured abdominal aorta, a
perforated duodenal ulcer, and an appendicitis in a pregnant woman. The latter
diagnosis is tough, as I would later discover as a first year resident when I
missed one. The patient turned out to have a ruptured appendix, and then
miscarried. Those were very humble years.

<p>And I almost missed diagnosing a heart attack in a 42 year old woman -- the
condition was considered very rare in women at the time. Overconfidently and
aggressively, I set a fractured femur by myself. It seemed like it took
forever, and I probably should have called the orthopedic resident, but it
turned out ok. I did have one bad scene on a busy Saturday night with a black
diabetic man with foot infection. I basically chewed him out for not coming in
earlier for care, and got into a noisy argument with him. In retrospect, it
was likely a racist incident on my part, since I probably would have
approached the case differently if he were a white person. Again, I could have
called in the surgical resident for help, but I have always had an independent
streak, often reluctant to ask for help. Unfortunately this trait persisted. I
would have considered going into Emergency Medicine if it had been a specialty
at the time -- it was fun, challenging, exciting, and with lots of opportunities
to do a lot of of good including saving lives.

<p>I finish my internship on the general surgical service, and got to do
several procedures, including an above knee amputation, and two tracheotomies.
Mt. Carmel had given me fairly good preparation for my next assignment as a
general medical officer in the Navy.

<h1 class="page-break">US Navy: 1963-71</h1>

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<p>KINGSVILLE, TEXAS

<p>This was really a Godforsaken place. It was unbearably hot and with not
much going on except the King Ranch, Texas A&amp;I, and the Naval Auxiliary Air
Station. The saying went that if the Earth ever needed an enema, the nozzle
would be inserted in Kingsville. In July, 1963, I drove down to Kingsville
alone. Kathy was pregnant with Patrick at the time, and would be flying in
with 8 month-old Laurie as soon as I found housing. I found a house to rent
and bought all new furniture. We had very special neighbors -- Jim and Nancy
Hamrick. Unlike most military recruits, I never received had any basic
training -- just read a book for intro into Navy. Jim had to show me how to put
my uniforms together the first time.

<p>Jim was a jet fighter instructor, and somehow talked me into going out with
him for an aircraft carrier landing. This would be far and away one the most
exciting events of my life - being in the back seat of a Navy jet, landing on
the carrier three times, and getting catapulted off the ship. We flew out to
the ship in the Gulf of Mexico, near Corpus Christy. Thirty minutes after
takeoff, Jim told me to look down - the carrier USS Lexington was our target.
It looked like a matchbox, and Jim told me that we were going in. We landed on
the ship going 110 mph, and were brought to an instant stop by the arresting
cable. It felt like my guts were coming out. After a 15 minute wait, we were
then shot off the ship by a catapult. For a split second, I could see water
straight ahead, but we pulled up quickly and climbed - it beat any roller
coaster! We made three landings and got shot off three times. The catapult
takes you from 0 to 150 mph in two seconds. I naturally barfed, like everyone
else, but not until after the final landing. They had issued us special knives
to carry for the flight. Jim explained that the knife was to be used to cut
your way out of the plane if it missed the deck, hit the water, and sunk. He
said that the two options would be to either cut your way out of the thick
plexiglass cockpit, or to eject from under water and then attempt to cut the
parachute lines. He admitted that he had not decided which option he would
choose, since neither would likely be successful.

<p>Jim introduced me to many wild and crazy Navy and Marine pilots, and took
me to "Marine Corps Mess Night. This involved drinking multiple toasts of wine
to everyone on up the chain of command, all the way to the president. I never
made it that far, needing to adjourn to Jim's car for a several hour nap. On
the way home at 5 AM, I noticed that we going down Santa Gertrudes Avenue at
100 mph in his station wagon. I casually pointed this out, and his reply was
"this is very unusual for me." But we continued the trip home at the same
speed. He had the day off, but I had to go in for my job as Chief of
Dependents Clinic., my primary duty being a general practitioner for wives and
kids of active duty servicemen. This included the wife of the Base Commander,
who really liked her pain medications.

<p>I was quite na&iuml;ve at the time. Once in the clinic I answered a
telephone call once from a woman whose husband was away for sea duty. She told
me that Her Nature was out of control, and she didn't know what to do about
it. A navy corpsman had to explain to me that the woman really meant by
"nature," that she was "horny," and didn't know what do about it. I had
trouble living that one down.

<p>I also saw active duty men and did a fair amount of minor surgery. One of
these procedures was excising a 2X5 inch tattoo from a sailor's chest. The
tattoo was "Mary." This was a definite problem, since his current wife's name
was Elizabeth.

<p>One of my co-workers was Bob Montgomery, the other general medical officer,
who had been drafted and hated the Navy with a passion. This peaked one night
after office hours, when he was called in from home to see an officer with a
sore index finger. Bob was quite upset for having to come in for a mild
condition which had been present for several days. After a negative Xray, he
told the man that he had in an inflamed finger. Bob recommended the classic
treatment for inflammation -- heat, rest, and elevation. He told the man that
the best way to do this was to take his finger and put it where the sun don't
shine.(not Bob's actual words)

<p>Bob and I had to take night and weekend call with the other two MDs, both
flight surgeons. One Saturday, I rode a helicopter out to pick up the body of
a student pilot who had crashed his jet. When told that he was Vietnamese, I
asked, what is that? This was 1963, and I had no idea what or where Vietnam
was. But we would all find out soon enough.

<p>The middle of September, 1963 arrived, but there was no sign of our
expected baby. Kathy had not had a period since Laurie was born. This was
before the time of easily done accurate pregnancy tests, and ultrasound was
years ahead, so we had no idea of the due date. Civilian Obstetrician Ben
Martin briefly attempted an induction, but was unsuccessful. Kathy was very
discouraged, and her mother needed to get back to Cleveland after being with
us for a week. So on September 22, on a Sunday night, I took Kathy for the
bumpiest possible road trip -- we went over very rough railroad tracks many
times. Crude, but it something worked.

<p>The next morning, real labor started, and we headed for Kleberg County
Hospital in Kingsville. Labor was fairly rapid, and Ben gave the saddle block.
Shortly after, when I noticed the nurse whispering to him, I knew that Kathy's
blood pressure was dropping. Ben knew that I was aware of this, and instructed
the nurse to have me inject medication IV to get the pressure back up. This
was smart, as I knew where her good veins were, and also kept me busy. It
worked, and shortly after, Patrick James Mueller, Apgar 10, arrived on the
scene. He was a hungry baby from the beginning, the pediatrician advising us
to pick up a box of cereal for him on the way home from the hospital. He
quickly earned the nicknames "Oinkwick," and "Paddy Pig".

<p>While she was there, Kathy's mom talked me into removing a small facial
mole. Unwisely, I agreed to operate, feeling it was a good chance to
demonstrate my plastic surgical "skills." The final result looked fairly good,
but required what seemed like a gallon of local anesthetic. Although not a big
deal at the time, it would be considered ethically questionable for a doctor
to operate on family members.

<p>In November of '63, on my way back to the base from lunch, I heard the news
that President John F. Kennedy had been shot and killed in Dallas. Everyone
was shocked and even the doctors were crying. Our clinic closed for the day.

<p>The duty in Kingsville was bad news in a lot of ways -- terribly hot, boring,
lazy coworkers, texan. Since I had a year of sea duty ahead of me at some
point, I decided to get it out of the way and exit Godawfultexas. So we left
The Lone Star state after only one year, heading out at one minute past
midnight, driving until we were out of Texas. Luckily, we were getting a great
location - San Diego.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">San Diego, California</h1>

<p>USS Seminole (AKA-104), 1964-65

<p>Probably from homesickness, we drove back to Ohio before going out west to
California. Ernie and Florence Mazzaferri were heading to the Air Force base
in San Bernadino, CA, so we drove out with them. It was a fairly nice trip
till we blew a tire in the 100 degree desert outside of Las Vegas. I changed
the tire myself in the heat, on a hill off the interstate and we spent the
night in Vegas. The next day we reached San Diego, and could not believe the
perfect weather. Taking in the cool breezes in the hills overlooking the city,
Kathy proclaimed at the ripe old age of 24, "I could retire here."

<p>We spent the next several days in temporary Navy housing, then rented a
housed in north San Diego. We moved out after one week, as it was too far from
the ship, and Patrick had fallen through a floor-level window, fortunately
unharmed. Marlo and Kathy Holland, friends from Kingsville, helped us move to
65 East Whitney in Chula Vista. I drove a U-Haul trailer, and Marlo and I
moved all of our appliances in one day. Since I was repaying my medical school
loans, we never had enough cash to buy a house, and so it turned out that we
rented the Chula Vista house for the next four years.

<p>While waiting for the Seminole to return from a six month western Pacific
cruise, I worked at the Amphibian base in Coronado. The Ship finally arrived,
and I reported on or about August 1, and was given a one hour orientation to
the ship by Ezra Sokol, the departing medical officer. This intro was mainly
learning the combination of the sick bay safe which held morphine, "medicinal"
brandy, and a fifth of "Old Methuselah" whiskey. The Semi-hole, as we called
her, was an attack cargo class, with a crew of 300, including 25 officers. We
had room for a few hundred combat troops, but carried mostly guns, artillery,
jeeps, etc. It looked like a very quiet year, to be spent mostly in port at
San Diego, since the ship had just completed its 6 month tour in the western
Pacific. We did have some fun in port. On one occasion, the ship's navigator
asked for some special medical effects at the bachelor's party for Ed Donahue,
soon to be married. He wanted to slip Ed a Mickey Finn (a knock-out
concoction), then paint his privates with purple dye. I obliged, using chloral
hydrate for the Mickey, and mixed up some dilute gentian violet for the pubic
painting. All went according to plan, with Donahue getting his special
"treatment." I woke up at 5 AM on the patio, and suspected I had also had

<p>some of the chloral-hydrate-laced beer. Fortunately, the guys did not take
any additional advantage of their medical officer.

<p>In early January 1965, we set sail for the western Pacific (WESTPAC) and
Marine Corps war games in Hawaii, expecting to return home in 6 weeks. Shortly
after leaving port, I was able to talk to Kathy via ham radio hookup. At the
first, she almost disconnected, thinking it was a telephone salesmen
attempting to sell hams. It was unbelievably great talking to her, but then
she asked what I thought of the bombing. Ship's personnel had not been told
that the US had started bombing North Vietnam, in a huge escalation of the
war. Shortly after this conversation, the ham radio connection was
discontinued - we were now definitely IN A REAL WAR IN VIETNAM.

<p>It took two weeks to reach Hawaii, and the ship was anchored in Pearl
Harbor, for a month, waiting for orders. I visited Kauai, Honolulu, and some
other sites, but was mostly bored. Finally, some marines came on board, and we
left The Islands for Okinawa. My marine roommate MD was Pete Killinger from
Houston, and he later moved to Chula Vista as a resident in pediatrics. After
dropping off the marines in Okinawa, we left for a week of R&amp;R in Yokosuka
Japan. I bought a 12 dozen set of glassware and a set of Noritake china for
Kathy, and also purchased a tailor-made formal dress uniform at a Japanese
shop. The clerk who took my measurements reminded me of a Japanese
interrogator out of an old war movie. I half expected him to slit my throat
while yelling Yankee pig! This was only 20 years since the end of WW II, so I
was expecting almost anything. Apparently, I had seen too many war movies, and
the only thing that got cut was my hair.

<p>On April 7, when I called home from Japan, someone at the house answered,
with the message that Kathy was in the hospital, but everything was fine. I
finally got a call through to the Naval Hospital San Diego, and talked to
Kathy. She was a little groggy, but gave me the news that Thomas Gilbert had
entered the world on that day. Dr. Bob Brown, whom I knew, had delivered Tom,
and everything was fine. While talking to Kathy, she mentioned that something
was wrong with her arm. I realized that her IV was infiltrated, and advised
her to call the nurse. Also, I told here that I had previously asked Florence
Mazzaferri to come down from San Bernardino to help out with Laurie and
Patrick. Back then, the average hospital stay after delivery was 3-4 days, and
Florence stayed a week or so, helping Kathy a lot.

<p>The Seminole left Japan the next day, for the one week trip back to Hawaii.
We ran into a near-typhoon, and I was told later that the ship had almost
capsized. Strangely enough, I never got seasick during the entire cruise,
probably because I hit the sack as soon as the weather turned bad. It's hard
to imagine, but once I spent 24 straight hours in bed. My corpsman would bring
sick sailors up to my quarters, with stethoscope, tongue blades, flashlight
etc. I could conduct any exam necessary by just managing to wake up and sit on
the side of my bunk. There was one bit of excitement when I saw a sailor with
possible appendicitis. Capt. Dixon did not want to lose time with this - it
was very tricky - if I decided that he required surgery, we would need to hook
up with a larger ship, transfer him and me over, have their doctor give a
spinal anesthetic, while I did the appendectomy. had seen only 3 or 4 appys in
my young career. Fortunately, the patient either a virus or was malingering.
quickly recovered, and did not require surgery.

<p>I did have time for a lot of reading during the trip. I read all 1400 pages
of Eastman's Obstetrics , plus Heller's ""Catch 22," and several of Ian
Fleming's "new" series of James Bond's thrillers. I tried to quit smoking
during this time, but with cigarettes selling for 10 cents a pack, it was not
an ideal time to quit. I did grow a mustache, which was not permitted at the
time in a very conservative Navy. The XO repeatedly threatened to shave it by
force, but never did. I kept the 'stache, probably just to be ornery.

<p>We were away from home 4 months, and when we sailed in, San Diego Bay never
looked better. Kathy met me at the pier, reintroduced me to Laurie and Pat,
and I got to meet young Tom for the first time. Then two weeks later, I was
given a one week assignment with the Navy Seals. This involved being flown out
to Santa Catalina Island, driving a cracker box ambulance around and going out
in an LST (landing craft) with my tiny first aid kit. The Seals were the
wildest and craziest bunch I had ever been with, and most refused any medical
care - they were too macho for it. Most of them would go to Vietnam, mining
harbors, and I learned later that some would even be swimming in the Hanoi
sewers, doing as much damage as possible. They were nuts, but I was glad they
were on my side. Regretfully, a high percentage of the Seals would never
return.

<p>After I returned to the ship, we had to prepare for a major inspection, and
the ships commanding officer, Captain William Dixon became a Captain Queeg -
as in Caine Mutiny. He compulsively pushed everyone to the limit. This lead to
two of our senior officers being placed in the psychiatric ward, and who both
eventually received medical discharges. Kevin Hanlon, the ship's executive
officer (second in command) also had some kind of a nervous breakdown, and was
replaced. His dad had been an admiral, but Kevin had a less than sensational
career. He had been a submariner, and rumor had it that he once gave an order
to dive while there were still some sailors on deck. If true, this would taken
him off the admiral track.

<p>Baby Thomas Gilbert turned out to be a genuine navy kid - conceived in Navy
housing, born in Naval Hospital, and baptized on the U.S Navy Seminole bridge,
using the ship's bell as the baptismal font. Ernie and Florence were
godparents, and we had a big party back at the house.

<p>In my spare time while in port, I worked in the Ob Department at Naval
Hospital San Diego. They had a huge volume and an excellent program. In
addition to an additional 3 years in a great city, these were good reasons for
applying there for a residency.

<p>My Seminole replacement arrived in mid July 1965, but the Captain insisted
that I stay on board for at least one week to orient the new MD. He was Leroy
Bloomburg, a somewhat drab and annoying OSU graduate, but who had a very nice
wife Sally. Sounds like an apt description of a navy M.D.

<p>I was finally permitted to depart from the Seminole (nicknamed "Semi-Hole"
by some of us) in late July, 1965. The ship was at first anchored in San Diego
Bay, and was due to arrive in port. As I was very anxious to leave ASAP, when
I heard of a landing barge going ashore to Coronado I got my gear together,
got on the barge, became seasick while the boat circled for 2 hours, and
finally met Kathy and the kids on the shore. My very long one year tour of sea
duty was finally over.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">Ob-Gyn Residency, Naval Hospital San Diego, 1965-68</h1>

<p>Residency at Naval Hospital San Diego ("Balboa") started August 4, 1965.
Co-residents were Garv McClain, Ernie Wood, and Dale Passick. Garv and Ernie
were great guys and remain good friends. Dale turned out to be a jerk, and
would be bounced from the program after 2 years for moonlighting. Almost no
one was moonlighting back then, since most people were usually just too tired
to do anything else after slaving away at Balboa.

<p>Our patient volume was huge. In obstetrics, there were far too many wives
to take care of, so many of them were sent to civilian MDs. But we kept all
complicated cases, first pregnancies, and previous cesarean sections. The
Chief of Ob/Gyn was another one of my silver-haired father figures, Dr. Tom
Lebherz. He was bright, stimulating, challenging, funny, and intellectually
stimulating. He was no-nonsense, and drove us pretty hard. We were always
over-worked, and got very little sleep with the every third night call
schedule. When one resident complained about lack of sleep, Lebherz told him
to take an amphetamine. (He probably wasn't kidding). One day, I had been up
all night and worked in the clinic the next day. I was trying to do a biopsy,
but all of the instruments I tried were jammed. After the fourth one failed, I
threw it against the wall and screamed "g-d d--n it!" The patient reported me,
and I received a talking to by the Chief. He seemed sympathetic to my plight,
but our hectic hours continued.

<p>We were theoretically supposed to have one afternoon off each week. One
day, I had too much work to do to take off... My second year resident, Bob
Brown was a very tough guy, but ordered me to go home and get some rest. I
finally did, but the next morning he royally chewed me out for not getting my
work done. This nonsense continued for 2 years until Bob left. He was an
excellent physician, always placing the patient first, but everyone else could
just go to hell.

<p>We worked hard, but also played hard when we could. There was a "Resident's
Night Out" each month, where the Ob/Gyn staff covered for us, and all the
residents got together for a social evening together. Many overindulged, but
paid for it the next morning when we returned to work. Rumors had it that two
residents were drunk when they made rounds one morning after one of these
party nights.

<p>We also enjoyed the great San Diego weather and beaches as much as
possible. One Sunday we joined the Woods for a picnic at Mission Bay Park. We
were goofing around and didn't notice 4 year-year-olds Patrick and David Wood
playing in a tiny boat out on the water. When we finally heard David crying,
we saw them out on the lake, around 100 yards from shore. Fortunately, the
water was calm, and Ernie and I swam out and got them back safely.

<p>Bob Brown and I had an interesting problem one night. We didn't call it an
ethical dilemma, but it sure was that. A pregnant patient with severe heart
disease had been admitted in her 30th week. She suddenly became unresponsive,
and by the time we got to her, it was too late for CPR. I asked Bob about
possibly doing a post-mortem C section to attempt to save the baby, but he
overruled me. I don't remember how his reasoning went, but there was no way he
would allow me to operate on this patient. These were the days before
ultrasound, fetal monitoring, bioethics, and living wills.

<p>During Kathy's pregnancy with Danny, her blood pressure was staying up, so
we hired a woman to come up from Tijuana once a week to clean the house. We
still get Felice Navidad cards from Condy at Christmas time. Kathy did fine
with the extra rest, but everyone agreed on an induction at 39 weeks. I was on
my 2 month rotation in pathology at the time, so things were more convenient
for me. The induction started early in the morning, and Dr. Lebherz ruptured
membranes in the afternoon. I knew the baby's position was fairly high at the
time, but everything seemed ok. An intern was sitting with Kathy, and came out
to tell me he was having trouble hearing the fetal heart tones. I was the
nearest resident, so I went in and listened myself. All I could hear at the
time was my own blood pounding through my ears. So we got another intern in
who finally heard Danny's heartbeat. This was before electronic monitoring.
Everything stayed ok until Kathy announced that she had to push. Lebherz
paternalistically told her she wasn't ready. But she really was, and we
high-tailed it to the delivery room. We all made it, and son #3 - Daniel
Robert, made the scene late in the day on September 14, 1966. His namesakes
were Kathy's brother Uncle Dan Reddy and her Dad Gil.

<p>Having four kids close together was challenging in many respects, including
religious ones. I was having many second thoughts about Catholicism at the
time, including family planning issues. I could rationalize doing tubal
ligations, but some of the staff gave me a hard time. Once I was assisting Dr.
John Hillis on a repeat C-Section. When it came time to do the tubal, Hillis
said that since I was Catholic, I should go stand in the corner, facing away
from the patient, while he tied her tubes. But before long, I was doing tubal
ligations myself. We didn't do many, as they had to be approved by the
hospital "Ethics Committee." More often than not, requests for tubals were
often turned down. I recall one Committee sterilization refusal which stated
that "the patient could take birth control pills for another couple of years."
As a general rule, to be approved for sterilization, a woman had to be age 35
with 3 kids, 30 with 4, 25 with 5, or have a life-threatening medical
condition. I had also begun to prescribe birth control pills. All of this
seemed to make little sense to me, so I thought it was a good time for an
official conference.

<p>I had a pleasant meeting with the chief Catholic chaplain, a monsignor as I
recall. After a 2 hour discussion, he finally said: "Well Dr. Mueller, I have
certainly learned a lot from you today. But I still can't approve of you doing
tubal ligations or prescribing oral contraceptives, or having your own wife
use any family planning method other than "rhythm." He said that if I did any
of these things, I could not receive the sacraments. So much for Catholic
ethics in 1967!

<p>In May 1968, Pope Paul VI. issued the infamous "Humane Vitae" encyclical.
In essence, this stated that the Church condemned the use of artificial
contraception. The Pope ignored his own advisors who recommended a revision of
the previous ban on all contraceptives, including birth control pills. Most
Catholics ignored the encyclical at that time, and continued to ignore it.

<p>Fortunately, we finally found a realistic spiritual advisor. He turned out
to be Fr. Al Norcavage, whom we had known in Kingsville. Al had been Catholic
chaplain on the carrier Oriskany, which saw a lot of action in Vietnam, and
was known as a bad luck ship, losing a lot of pilots and planes. On one of the
cruises, he had a "nervous breakdown" of some sort. After Danny was born, we
ran into him at a San Diego restaurant. He appeared to be in fairly good shape
at the time, and agreed to do the baptism. With Ernie and Jeannie Wood as
godparents, Fr. Al began the ceremony. After a few minutes, he stopped the
ceremony and shakily admitted that he just couldn't continue, and asked me to
finish the baptism. I did it, being very careful to say all of the right words
and not to miss anything. But later, as Dan was growing up, there was
sometimes a question of whether the exorcism part had been done correctly.

<p>The last year of residency went fairly well. Unfortunately, Tom Lebherz
retired as department chief, and was replaced by Bill Lucas. Lucas arrived
toward the end of Leberz' tour, and he and Tom had constant battles. One
involved a 3-months pregnant patient with severe diabetes. She was rapidly
losing her vision, and Lucas recommended a "therapeutic" abortion. This was
years before the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision liberalizing abortions.
Lebherz was a staunch Catholic, and talked the patient out of having the
abortion. This highly incensed Lucas, but as it turned out, the patient had a
fairly uneventful pregnancy, with no additional visual loss. I had mixed
feelings about the ethical issues involved, but it appeared that Lebherz had
given some good obstetric advice. Lucas had at first seemed like a breath of
fresh air - he was very bright and an excellent surgeon. But he turned out to
be a lousy chief, a poor educator, and gave the residents very little help.

<p>We enjoyed the social life in San Diego, and took trips to conferences in
San Francisco and Las Vegas. I presented my thrombophlebitis paper in Vegas,
and it would later be published. Writing a paper took a lot of extra time. I
didn't realize how much time I was giving it until one of the better staff
men, Marco Labudovitch, pulled me aside one day for a man-to-man talk. He
pointed out that I was not spending enough time with the family, and that if I
wanted to save my marriage, I would need to prioritize my life. It turned out
to be excellent advice. Kathy and I even got into a bowling league, and rolled
with the department team, the "Gynobs." It was fun, and there was even more
excitement one night when we had an earthquake -- the pins on one alley were all
standing at first, but fell over when the quake hit.

<p>The kids stayed fairly healthy in the great San Diego climate. Laurie had
eye muscle surgery, and Tom had the same procedures on. The otherwise robust
Patrick gave us a scare when he developed a rash and fever - there was some
meningitis in the area, but it turned out to be a simple virus. A few days
after the extensive blood tests, he was limping, and his MDs worried about a
severe bone infection secondary to femoral artery punctures. Everything
eventually turned out ok, but it was scary.

<p>All of this kept Kathy very busy juggling car time, since we had only the
'63 Chevy for the first 3 years in San Diego - I don't know how she did it. We
would finally become a 2-car family when Bob Brown sold me his '52 Chevy
junker for $100 in 1967. In spite of running me ragged for 2 years, Bob and I
turned out to be fairly good friends at least we respected each other. He
volunteered for a year in Vietnam as a surgeon. We corresponded a few times,
and as I was overly gung-ho at the time, I was considering requesting duty in
Vietnam myself. Thankfully, Bob advised against it. The war seemed close
enough. Early in '68, I delivered a patient whose husband had just been shot
down and killed in Vietnam. And on a weekend trip to San Francisco with Kathy,
I was in uniform, and was heckled and spit upon by some anti-war hippies.

<p>Toward the end of residency in 1968, we submitted our requests for future
locations. My first choice was that I did not want overseas duty, asking
specifically that I did not want Yokosuka, Japan. My one week visit there
while on the Seminole had soured me on the Orient. One of our staff men,
Bythel Dutton had just completed a 3 year tour there, which he really enjoyed.
But he admitted that during the wintertime, "your kids might not be quite as
warm as you'd like." The thought of the kids shivering for three winters did
not appeal to us. Despite all of this, I was hearing rumors that my next
assignment would indeed be YOKOSUKA! True to form, Bill Lucas never said
anything to me about this. Frustrated, I asked for help from my friendly Ohio
congressman William McCulloch. More rumors were floating around -- one had it
that Admiral Warden, the hospital Chief, said that if I didn't want to go to
Japan, maybe I could go to Vietnam. Interestingly, I wanted to have foot
surgery so that if I did have to go there, I wanted to be able to run to the
nearest foxhole as quickly as possible!

<p>Residency ended officially on August 4, 1968, and I had foot surgery a few
days later. Everything went ok until one week post op, my left leg became
painful. The orthopedist saw me, removed the cast, and it felt better
immediately. When I later described the situation to Ernie Mazzaferri, he gave
me an interesting opinion. He had seen similar cases, in which patients died
suddenly, immediately after the cast was removed. Their leg pain had been due
to a blood clot, and when the cast was removed, the clot broke loose, went to
the lungs, and caused instant death. But I had survived, more or less intact.
Unfortunately, the benefits of surgery lasted only three months until I began
having foot pain again.

<p>Six weeks after surgery, both of my casts were removed, and I was free to
travel. I called the Navy detailer who told me that a position had opened in
Charleston, SC, and wondered if I would be interested. A Navy
Japanese-American ob/gyn stationed in Charleston had never been to Japan, and
wanted to be reassigned to Yokosuka. So after much ado, I would take his
place.

<p>We left San Diego the end of summer, driving our brand new 1968 Ford Torino
Squire station wagon, for the cross-country trip east. It was necessarily a
quick but not scenic trip, with 5year old Laurie, Patrick 4, Tom 3, and Baby
Dan, almost 2. As we approached Flagstaff, Arizona, Tom barfed, and the
decision was easily made not to visit the Grand Canyon. After a quick visit to
Delphos and Cleveland, we then headed south to historic Charleston, SC.

<p>

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">Charleston, South Carolina -- 1968-71</h1>

<p>Arriving in Charleston, we moved into Navy housing at Hunley Park, just
across the street from the huge air force base, and 20 minutes to Naval
Hospital. After checking in, I discovered that I had replaced 3 doctors who
were leaving. Unfortunately, the obstetric work load was not proportionately
decreased, meaning that the "slavery" and long hours would continue. We were
on call every fourth night, and usually got little sleep. Every night was
busy, and we gave our own saddle blocks (spinal anesthetics) for delivery,
since there was no in-house anesthesia coverage. One night, I had 3 patients
ready to deliver at the same time, so, in assembly line fashion, I gave each
their saddle, and managed to deliver each without major problems. We rarely
called in the back-up Ob/Gyn, since he would be on call the following night
and needed the sleep.

<p>One of most exciting deliveries I ever did involved our new next door
neighbor, Susan Spage, whose husband was at sea. She called one morning
thinking labor might be starting, so I got dressed and had Kathy go over to
time her contractions. Just as I met them in Susan's driveway, her membranes
ruptured. I had planned to take my VW bug, but Kathy wisely suggested using
the station wagon. Being at rush hour, it was slow going to the hospital. In
fact we didn't make it! Half way there, Susan started pushing, and I had to
pull into a driveway. She then rapidly delivered in the front seat. I wrapped
baby and placenta in my shirt and dispatched them in a navy ambulance to
complete the trip to the hospital. A few minutes later, a sailor arrived with
a bucket of hot water. I told him to use the water to clean the blood and
amniotic fluid off of my car's front seat. I had discovered that one of the
reasons for having lots of hot water for home deliveries is to clean up the
mess afterward. I thought later that if we had taken the VW, we might have
made it to the hospital - it's hard to imagine a woman delivering in the front
seat of a VW!

<p>Socially, we met many open-minded Catholics, including Fr. Tom Donaher, a
Toledo native, previously married and widowed Navy chaplain. He was a great
guy and agreed with my own liberal ideas of modern family planning. Through
him, we met Fr. Bob Lauer, another chaplain, who became a very good friend.
Kathy was elected president of the Catholic Women's Club at the Air Force
Base, where we met Fr. Jack Benedetto, who would also be a long-time friend.
Kathy and I were members of Jack's parish counsel, and I was a lecturer at
Sunday mass. We had many home masses at the house, some of which I organized
and scripted.

<p>I had fun as a coach for the boys T-Ball "Jotter" team, with Pat, Tom, and
Dan all playing on the same team at one point. The primary function of the
coach was to tend to the player's personal needs, such as tying their shoes
and taking them into the woods for potty calls. Laurie also played ball on a
Hunley Park team, as well as activities with the Girl Scouts.

<p>The Charleston summers were very hot, and we cooled off with beer and
breezes at Bob Lauer's beach house on "Sticker Beach" (Isle of Palms). One
weekend, Kathy flew up to Cleveland with the four kids to her cousin Cheryl
Neiheiser's wedding. I was on call, so couldn't go. Coincidentally, old
Delphos buddy Mike Wulfhorst blew into town, and we spent a crazy night
partying at Lauer's, along with Bob and Schizi (short for schizophrenic)
Wagner, a fellow priest who had just returned from missionary work in South
America. (Details)

<p>Our Ob/Gyn staff shortage continued until the third year in Charleston. We
finally got some extra doctors, had more time off, and could finally enjoy
some extra curricular activities. Patrick and I took guitar lessons together,
with an instructor who also did marriage counseling. She was a born-again
Southern Baptist, and I once overheard her tell a couple that their main
problem was spiritual, and they would just have to get down on their knees and
pray to the Lord for wisdom. She also asked my advice on several occasions,
and for this service, gave me a discount on the guitar lessons. I took lessons
until one day, I looked out the window and thought "What in the world was I
doing here? I never practiced, and hated to play, but did perform at one wild
party. There was more than the usual heavy alcohol consumption, and some of us
did a few renditions - Manley Huchinson on Jew's Harp, Dick Coleman on piano,
and me singing and playing a broken 6 string guitar. The feature of the night
was my version of "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head," from the hit movie
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." I was not aware that our jamming had been
secretly taped, but at a baptism party the next day at Ed and Barb Vogel's,
they played the "song." When I heard the awful recording, I quickly destroyed
it, because of possible future challenges to my sanity. But Barb also composed
a personalized limerick to mark my musical swan song:

<blockquote>
There once was an old buckeye stud,<br>
Whose ears always filled up with crud.<br>
His feet were a mess,<br>
But his voice was the best.<br>
No one could sing 'Rain Drops' like Bud."<br>
</blockquote>

<p>My feet really were a mess, despite the surgery in San Diego. I consulted
the navy orthopedists, who prescribed special tailor-made shoes. After I had
worn them for 3 months, one of the nurses asked me why I was still limping
around. If anything, my feet hurt more than ever. I figured that the orthopods
had more or less given up on me when they said the condition could warrant a
medical discharge, with disability, from the Navy. But I wasn't emotionally
ready for that step, and found a podiatrist (foot doctor) who trimmed off my
calluses and advised me about more comfortable shoes. What would help the most
was not to spend such long hours working, with the prolonged standing and
walking.

<p>On July 20, 1969, we had a moon party at the house to watch the first lunar
landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. After the party, we noticed that
Danny, age 4, was acting strangely. He was yelling that there were bugs in his
room, but a thorough search revealed no insects of any kind. But by 3AM, as he
continued yelling about "buggies," we took a closer look at him. We found an
empty baby aspirin bottle, and because of a possible aspirin overdose, I ran
him up to the ER at Naval Hospital. We drew a salicylate level and watched him
for two hours. He was somewhat more hyperactive than usual, but otherwise
normal, and had no further hallucinations. We left the ER, but as soon as we
hit arrived home, he started yelling about "buggies." He still looked more or
less normal, so I just stayed with him the rest of the night. The salicylate
level indicated a definite aspirin overdose, but he eventually stopped
hallucinating.

<p>We had another party the night before my written Ob/Gyn board exams.
Nothing unusual happened that night, but the next morning , Kathy was having
severe leg pains. We were concerned about possible thrombophlebitis, and she
had an appointment with the internist, which turned out to be at the same time
as my exams. Kathy turned out to be okay, and I also passed.

<p>In the spring 1970, I attended the annual American College of OB/GYN
meeting in New York City. Air Force Chaplain Jack Benedetto arranged for me to
stay a few nights in the East Village, with his brother Bob, a Paulist "street
priest." The first night, Bob gave me an eye-opening tour of the back alleys
of his very rough neighborhood. I went into the city for my meeting the next
morning, and got back very late that night. The bad neighborhood required
extra security measures, which for Bob's third floor apartment meant using
three keys to open the door. That night, the first 2 keys worked ok, but I
couldn't get the door open with the third key. I worked on this for awhile,
when I heard a husky male voice say "What the hell do you think you're doing?"
I turned around to see this drunken guy with a very long knife coming after me
- apparently thinking I was trying to break in. I did the fastest talking of
my life and was thinking about kicking him downstairs just to get out of
there. Fortunately, he was a little too drunk to stab me, so just scooted past
him, ran downstairs, and luckily caught a cab, went back downtown, and stayed
the night with my buddy Garv McClain who was in from Spain for the meeting. I
couldn't reach Bob for 2 days, and did not tell Kathy about the episode until
she arrived in New York later that week. She asked if we were going down the
The Village to visit Bob, so I had to tell her about my adventure.

<p>With more time off than before, I was able to moonlight at the local public
health family planning clinic. The preferred contraceptive method was the IUD,
particularly the "Dalkon Shield" type. One night, a mother brought in her 14
year old daughter to have an IUD inserted while she was having her very first
period. I managed to get an IUD in - whether it worked or not I never found
out. At the time, in 1970, the Dalkon Shield was promoted as being a highly
effective device. Unfortunately, a few years later, it was found to be a very
poor one, with a high pregnancy rate. Worse yet, it also had a high infection
rate, and caused several maternal deaths. This came about because of
deceitful, unethical research practices, some of which were done at John's
Hopkins.

<p>My boss at Charleston Public Health was big on elective abortions. Back
then, my somewhat liberal leanings were leading me to reconsider my stance on
abortion which had been the traditional Catholic one - no abortions. But it
seemed a natural progression to accept contraceptives, then sterilization,
then why not abortion for the contraceptive failures, and especially in cases
of mother's life, rape, or incest. The area of "mother's health" seemed broad
enough to include many cases. A major stumbling block here was who will make
this decision? Wouldn't the most fair way be to have the (potential) mother
make the choice? This was happening before the US Supreme Court Roe v. Wade
decision liberalizing abortion.

<p>In September, 1990, I spent a week job hunting in California. I interviewed
at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in San Jose which was affiliated with
Stanford's ObGyn department. The Kaiser approach interested me. This was a
very early version of an HMO, where I could concentrate on just being a
doctor, without worrying about the business part of it, similar to what I had
been doing in the Navy. But they had a tyrannical chief of OB, and the doctors
I met there weren't too happy with their situation. I also had an interview at
the prestigious Palo Alto Medical Clinic. California had just liberalized its
abortion laws, and during the interview, it became obvious that they were
looking for an Ob/Gyn to do their elective abortions. I realized that I really
did not want to work for this outfit, and spent most of the interview
defending my anti-abortion stance. A few days later at an OB-GYN meeting in
Newport Beach, I overheard an MD talking about doing abortions. He said that
when he did the first one, he felt "squeamish" about it, but after that, it
became much easier. It got me thinking -- why did he feel squeamish, and why
should they become easier to do? What were my instincts trying to tell me? At
that time, we had really wanted to go back to California to live. But in
addition to the abortion situation turning me off, the hippy kids of one of
the doctors got us wondering - is this the ideal place to raise a family?

<p>On the way back to Charleston from California, I stopped off in the
Cincinnati area to check out a job advertised in a prominent medical journal.
As the plane for Kentucky was taking off over southern California, I noticed
how brown everything looked from the air - they were having a lot of fires out
there. I also remembered how irritated my eyes had been while I was sitting in
a back yard of a home in Los Angeles. On that occasion, I had also noticed
that my white shirt had become dirty just from being worn in the LA smog. With
all of this in mind, the first thing I noticed about Northern KY was how GREEN
everything looked from the air. I then spent two days with my future partners,
Larry Hiltz and Vic Magary. They seemed to be nice enough guys, but I wasn't
absolutely convinced that I wanted to go into practice with them. Kathy and I
did get to meet their kids, who seemed to be well-rounded. One advantage would
be that we would be only three hours from my family in Delphos.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">My Mom Dies</h1>

<p>In early December 1970, I got a call from my sister saying that she was
worried about Mom. I called and she had an obvious facial paralysis. I told
her to call her doctor right away, and he sent her straight to the hospital. I
flew up to Delphos the next day. An arteriogram showed a cerebral aneurism,
but I had to talk her into having brain surgery. She did ok right after the
operation, but one week later, we were called to the hospital. She had a major
stroke, never regained consciousness. She died on December 8. Mom was a great
gal, with the Reinemeyer sense of humor, always backed me up and was the
primary motivator for me to go into medicine. After Dad died in '53, she went
back to work as an RN at St. Rita's. I probably never told her how much that
meant for me. I was too busy thinking about my own future and where the money
would come from for my 8 years of school. If she hadn't gone back to work, I
would have had to get some kind of a job to support us and may not have gone
to college. Mom never wanted to bother anyone with her problems. She had
chronic headaches and was lonely, but rarely complained. Mom was well-known
and well-liked, and the funeral was unforgettable. At the entrance to the
funeral at St. John's Church, there was an honor guard of nurses in full
uniform, in their whites and wearing blue and red capes. Mom was very proud of
being a nurse. I still get choked up just thinking about that scene - one of
the rare occasions where I can remember actually crying as an adult. I still
miss her, and regret that she didn't get down to Charleston more often.

<p>At Naval Hospital, I had some interesting cases, and one involved ethical
issues. This was a 15 week pregnant woman with a massive uterine infection. To
save her life, we did a hysterectomy with fetus-in situ, but the baby was too
immature to survive, during the last year in Charleston, I worked one
afternoon weekly in the prenatal clinic at the Medical College of Charleston.
The experience was broadening, as many southern medical routines contrasted
sharply with those I had learned in San Diego. Also realized that I was not
quite the "World's Greatest Obstetrician," after I missed a thyroid cancer in
a pregnant patient. There was also time to work on my first published article,
"Antepartum Thrombophlebitis: A Proposed Regimen of Therapy," which was
appeared in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1971.

<p>In February of '71, I got a call inviting me to visit Chelsea Naval
Hospital in Boston. I was tempted, as it was an academic situation and
affiliated with Harvard. Some MDs at Chelsea told me that if I came to Boston,
I would need to buy a house, and to pay for it would need to moonlight. After
much soul-searching, I turned it down. The hospital closed the following year,
and I would have had to move once more. So it was a good decision. There was a
lot of encouragement at the time for me to consider a career in the Navy, but
I declined. It was my opinion that the military really should not be in the
business of providing health care for the dependent wives and children of
servicemen.

<p>The Navy was also bugging me in other ways. We were having formal full
dress inspections every Saturday morning. Invariably, my uniform would be not
quite right - unshined shoes, unbuttoned coat, collar devices on the wrong
side. The Commanding Officer told us once that we were the worst-looking
officers he had ever seen. Most of us were more interested in being good
doctors, but he never mentioned our medical work. At our last Saturday
inspection, I was running late, and couldn't find my hat. I talked to the guy
on call at the hospital, who said: "I found your hat. It is so dirty you could
use it for either a khaki or dress white inspection." I didn't bother to go to
the inspection, luckily, they didn't take attendance.

<p>I was also disillusioned with our involvement in Vietnam, and wanted to
disassociate myself from that situation. I was influenced by a 23 year old
Naval war hero named John Kerry who was a member of the "Vietnam Veterans
Against the War.' In April, he testified before a Senate hearing on Vietnam,
finishing with: "How do you ask a man to be the last man to die in a war, to
die for a mistake?" I reversed my previous hawkish attitude, and became active
in anti-war activities. There was a lot of anti-war sentiment in the nation at
the time, but not much inside the military itself. Having just been promoted
to Commander (army equivalent, Lt. Colonel), I was the highest ranking member
of an antiwar military officer's group, the "Concerned Officer's Movement." In
June we published a letter in the Navy Times detailing our opposition to the
Vietnam War. On the day it was published, I spent 2 hours being grilled by the
hospital Commanding Officer, defending my position. I have no regrets about my
antiwar actions, and felt vindicated years later when defense secretary Robert
MacNamara in 1998 indicated that at the time he also wanted the US out of the
War, but did not push for it. My intentions were to in some way help to stop
the killing and end the war. I could only hope that what I was doing did not
prolong the war in any way.

<p>One day in early '71, I was having trouble hearing on the phone, and went
to the ENT clinic to have the corpsman clean the wax out of my ear, only to
learn the there was no wax. I had a major hearing loss on the left side,
thought to be possibly from exposure to extremely loud hard rock music the
week before, and was treated for one week with steroids and nicotinic acid.
The medication didn't help, and the deafness was permanent. This turned out to
be my first major disability.

<p>I was honorably discharged from the Navy on July 29, 1971, and headed
straight for civilian life and private practice in Northern Kentucky. We were
returning to our roots, and what looked like a good place to raise a family.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">August, 1971 -- Civilian Life in Northern Kentucky</h1>

<p>Our first home in Kentucky was a nice duplex rental on Locust Hollow Lane
in Edgewood, KY. Then, after 10 years of paying rent, we bought our very first
house for $39.000, at 140 Williamsburg Dr. in Fort Mitchell. It was right next
to the of Beechwood Swimming Pool, and a only a few blocks from the kids
school at Beechwood. We were reluctant to send them to the local Catholic
school, Blessed Sacrament - its quality was unknown, and seemed very
conservative. We had some bad experiences with the Catholic schools in
Charleston, and Beechwood had a reputation as an excellent school. I was also
having lots of doubts about Catholicism in general.

<p>The private practice of medicine was a whole new adventure for me. It took
a long time to get used to billing patients for office visits and surgery,
things which I didn't have to be concerned about in the Navy. Also new to me
was telephoning prescriptions for patients. A pregnant woman would call in for
medicine for a cold, and we would either call her back or simply call a
prescription into the pharmacy. My partners were big on medicating pregnant
patients -- the year I got there, they were prescribing diet pills, diuretics,
during pregnancy. They were also using a lot of DepoProvera (long-acting
progesterone) to treat threatened miscarriage. I had always been very
reluctant to give any drug during pregnancy, and this was a bone of contention
between the three of us for several years. I also learned later that Larry had
used DES to treat threatened miscarriage. This drug was eventually shown to
cause genital defects in female fetuses.

<p>A few days before Easter of '72, Mike Wulforst and I paid a visit to old
buddy Mopey Gillon in Slippery Rock, PA. It was a nice get-together, but we
found out later that Mopey had a major drinking problem, requiring
hospitalization for beriberi - a vitamin deficiency usually found only in
third world countries. Gillon never did get a real job and never stopped
drinking, and would later die an alcoholic death.

<p>My concerns relating to conservative Catholicism continued for many years.
In September of 1972, The Cincinnati Enquirer published a letter from a
Catholic which was favorable to vasectomy. A brief editorial comment following
this letter stated: "The Enquirer is informed by Catholic sources that a
Catholic man who undergoes a vasectomy for birth-control purposes is guilty of
serious sin each time he engages in sexual relations thereafter." I considered
this statement ridiculous, and responded by sending my own letter, which
appeared in the Enquirer on September 19, 1972, under the title "Confused
Catholics." The letter:

<p>"I noted with interest your editor's note to the letter entitled "Vasectomy
and the Church." You somehow neglected to mention the names of your "Catholic
sources." Anyone making such a statement has turned a deaf ear to those
conscientious Catholics who are trying to work out their family planing
difficulties. This type of thinking only compounds the problems of myriad
Catholics and others who are victims of sexual dysfunction related to their
strict religious backgrounds. Following through on this statement, your
"Catholic Sources" would leave the sterilized man with only two choices: (1)
Have the vasectomy reversed (not a very successful procedure, and not very
practical, since he has already made the definitive decision in good
conscience); or (2) practice complete sexual abstinence (no comment needed on
this one).

<p>"Furthermore, 'guilty of serious sin each time he engages in sexual
relations' assumes that the Church maintains that the only objective of
marriage is the procreation of children. But hasn't this attitude been
modified by Vatican II to include and emphasize the mutual help and benefit of
husband and wife? And even the idea of what constitutes "serious sin" has been
open to much heated debate by respected theologians over the past several
years. In short, you have assumed the role of an unnamed confessor who has
given inhumane, indifferent, and illogical information to an already badly
confused Catholic public. At the very least, I believe you owe your readers a
list of the names and credentials Of your "Catholic Sources." Let them choose
their own confessor-advisor. Maurice J. Mueller, M. D."

<p>Later, I received a two page letter from our local bishop, which was highly
critical of my letter. His own letter ended: "To conclude, I can only add that
your letter to the Enquirer reflected something of the "badly confused
Catholic public mind" which you mistakenly charge the Editor with confusing
still further. This letter is written out of a sense of duty which I must
fulfill as Bishop of the Diocese. I know that you will accept it as such, in
the spirit of fraternal charity which motivates it. With cordial good wishes
for happiness in the Christmastide, believe me, Sincerely yours in Christ,
Richard H. Ackerman, Bishop of Covington.

<p>Not long after this, a neighbor called me a "hippy liberal." I probably did
have some liberal tendencies - I was interested in equality, tolerance, access
to health care, and eliminating poverty. I was a member of the ACLU for a year
or so, then dropped out because of their extremist and often nonsensical
views. I did have somewhat long hair and wore flared pants, but that was not
unusual in the early 70s.

<p>Several months after my Enquirer letter, senior partner Larry Hiltz opined
that the letter might have caused some of our patients to transfer to another
more traditional Ob/Gyn practice. But I thought it could also have attracted
some other more open-minded women.

<p>I did try to more or "keep the faith" by giving free family planning
lectures as part of "Precana" premarital programs. These talks detailed all of
the birth control methods. I tried very hard to be objective, but probably
emphasized The Pill more than natural family planning. At one session, after I
had listed the advantages of oral contraceptives, one women asked "Didn't the
Pope come out against birth control pills?" I answered without thinking too
much about it: "I think the Pope is wrong on that." This was to be my last
Precana conference -- I was not asked back.

<p>During this time, I became interested in sexual dysfunction, and began
treating some patients in the office. Probably the primary reason for my
interest was that it seemed like a fairly common problem, and no one else in
the area was providing this service. I used "Masters and Johnsons" techniques,
with less than spectacular results. It was not a big money maker for the
practice, since it is very time-consuming. One of my most challenging patients
was a man with impotence I gave him several testosterone injections, without
success. I did diagnose his diabetes, which was probably causing his erectile
dysfunction. But the couple did not get along, and eventually divorced.

<p>An even greater challenge was a married patient who was unable to
consummate her marriage of two years, because of vaginismus (painful,
intercourse). It was nearly impossible to do a vaginal exam, and I attempted
several office vaginal dilatations. I eventually referred her to a
psychiatrist, and she turned out to be a paranoid schizophrenic. She later
became pregnant, but was still almost impossible to examine -- was this another
immaculate conception? There was no rational explanation for the conception.

<p>In 1973 I had a major ethical challenge, receiving a call from a respected
local family physician telling me that the husband of one of my patients had
gonorrhea, contracted on a business trip. The man claimed that if his wife
found out, she would divorce him. The doctor asked me if I could figure out
some way to also treat her with antibiotics, without raising suspicion. It
happened that I had done a pap smear on her the week before, and it was mildly
abnormal. I called her and told her about the Pap smear and prescribed
ampicillin. This was over-treatment for her condition, but it prevented her
from getting GC. I felt conflicted about it at the time, but did not believe
it to be a major ethical problem. Many years later, I would use this case for
small group sessions with first year medical students, emphasizing that this
would not be appropriate modern management. Because of the AIDS situation
later on, this couple would have had to face the truth and go from there.

<p>An important historical Note: On March 29, 1973, the last U.S. troops left
South Vietnam, after more than 56, 000 were killed in the war. I always
wondered if anti-war activities like mine made any difference, and only hope
that they didn't prolong the war.

<p>Also in '73, I found out about a new smoking cessation program in late -- 
SmokeEnders, which used practical behavior modification techniques. A heavy
smoker since age 12, I had tried every possible way to stop. These included
Eskatrol, a combination of amphetamine and compazine, which did not work, and
left me pretty much on the ceiling most of the time. Kathy and I signed up for
SmokeEnders, and luckily, we had a great instructor. We completed the program
in 6 weeks, and since then, have been "smoke sober" A short time later, we
moved into our new house at 78 Superior Avenue.

<p>My longtime interest in ethics continued, and in 1975 I attended an ethics
conference at Mt. St Joseph's College in Cincinnati. I remember no details of
the meeting, except that Dr. Christian Barnard gave a very interesting talk on
the ethics involved in doing the world's very first human heart transplant.
Another participant was Dr. Andre Hellegers, an OB/Gyn from Georgetown. He was
involved in beginning their Bioethics program, and he became an inspiration
for me.

<p>Basketball was my preferred sport into the 70s, and I played in the annual
SEMC Staff-Resident's games until 1975. During my last game that year, I
managed to make one field goal, a running jumper from the side, and fouled out
after playing only 7 minutes. But I really did need some regular exercise, as
fellow doctor Lou Nutini told me I was getting fat - the scales showed 190 at
one point that year. So at age 39, I took up tennis. In the past, this was
considered to be a non-sport in Delphos, even a sissy-sport. I took lots of
lessons, but just wasn't cutting it. I was not playing as well as I thought I
should be. I tried it for a few years, but seemed to get worse instead of
better. The crowning point was during a mixed doubles match, when I served and
hit Kathy in the back with the ball. I reluctantly finished the match, but
never played again. I was wondering then if something bad was going on in my
body, besides middle age.

<p>Patrick joined the Boy Scouts, as did Tom later on, and I went on a few
camping trips with them. One of the last ones was in the winter, and I recall
sleeping indoors while the boys roughed it out in the cold. I was also a
member of one Eagle Scout review meeting. At the time, the Heimlich maneuver
was initially being publicized, and I asked the Eagle candidate how he would
manage a choking victim. He had never heard of the Heimlich Maneuver, but he
made Eagle rank anyway. I had also been an examiner for scouts going for first
class, but the kids knew very little about first aid, so I did not pass any of
them. They probably complained to their parents -- I was not asked back to help
with any further activities, and my brief second career in scouting came to an
end.

<p>In the 70's, my good friend and Board of Health Officer Dr. Bill Banks
appointed me to the District Board of Health. I enjoyed the monthly meetings,
which for the most part gave me an opportunity to socialize, drink lots of
martinis and wine, have a nice free meal, and help solve the many public
health quandaries of Northern Kentucky. Bill generally told us what to do, but
the Fiscal Court judge members of the Board were often difficult. The after
meeting activities were also fun and distracting. After 3 years on the Board,
its politics were becoming very old, and Bill Banks had left for a pediatric
residency. Since I was next in line for board chairmanship, it was a good time
to bid the Board of Heath farewell.

<p>I had an interest in fertility problems, and gave lectures in the subject
for SEMC Family Practice residents, in addition to talks on family planning.
Kathy and I had some great trips to American Fertility Society meetings, going
to Acapulco, Toronto, and Niagara Falls. No one in Greater Cincy was doing
infertility, and this was before reproductive endocrinology was a
subspecialty. Since there were no experts in the area, I even did a case of
tubal surgery a woman infertile with blocked fallopian tubes. Afterward, she
was still unable to conceive (the surgery didn't work). I later took a
microsurgery course in New Jersey, but decided this would not be the ideal
subspecialty for me. The course was good in its emphasis on meticulous
technique, and during the course, we were advised not to drink alcohol, smoke,
or drink coffee, since these substances could all give us the "shakes." This
became very apparent as I watched my own hands shaking while using the
operating microscope the morning after "moderate" wine and coffee use.

<p>The tubal surgery failure was not my worst surgical outcome. During this
time, a 60 year old patient had a stroke and died 4 days after an elective
hysterectomy for benign uterine fibroids. I was devastated, and did a lot of
my usual second guessing, namely, did she really need a hysterectomy? I was
generally a conservative surgeon, with patients more often than not asking for
an operation before I made the suggestion. But I became even more conservative
after this death. Also a 50 year old patient of mine committed suicide 6
months after hysterectomy. I felt very badly about her also, but at the time,
did not see any special connection between the surgery and her death. Still, I
would later lose a lot of sleep over both of these cases.

<p>Great summertime fun for me was canoeing with the 3 boys on the Whitewater
River in Indiana. I'm not sure if they enjoyed it as much as their dad, but we
went many times. Kathy finally consented to go on one of them. And par to the
course, I had my first turnover on the river with her in the boat. No
injuries, but it was her After a good rain, this river was really wild and
fast, but we had a great time.

<p>An important historical Note: On March 29, 1973, the last U.S. troops left
South Vietnam, after more than 56, 000 killed in the war.

<p>In 1977, I became interested in colposcopy as a way to screen and treat
abnormal pap smears, and took basic courses at the University of Chicago and
in Los Angeles. One of the best parts of the LA conference was getting
together with old friend Fr. Al Norcavage (Danny's baptizer by proxy). We had
a good visit with him, going to see Bette Midler at the Roxie, and throwing
matches back and forth with actor Jack Nicholson before the show. I did my
first 50 office colposcopes on normal patients, at no charge, before I began
doing the real thing. During this time, I was also doing laparoscopies. This
procedure had just started to get popular in the late '60s after I had
finished residency, so I had to learn the procedure on my own at various
graduate courses out of town. I never really felt comfortable with it, using
it mostly for chronic pelvic pain and infertility workups, but, regrettably,
never used it for tubal ligations.

<p>((Still using IV EtOH to stop premat. Labor))

<p>((Jan 17: Temp -25 F))

<p>Slowly but surely, my weight was creeping up, approaching 190 by March of
'77. Good friend Dr. Lou Nutini looked at me one day and said "Bud, you're
getting fat". So I started on the high-protein Adkins diet, with pretty good
results. The weight dropped to 175, and in May, we took a trip o NY for a
visit with old friends Jack and Eileen Bennedetto. I had at least 2 double
martinis. I liked them very dry - almost gin on the rocks. One of my drinking
problems was that I had been "raised" on beer, and when drinking alcohol of
any kind, would gulp the drink as it were a beer, whether it was gin, wine, or
Jack Daniels. So after the 2 martinis, I continued my gulping with the wine.
The next day, I had an acute gastritis, unable to keep anything down. They
considered taking me to the ER, but I slowly recovered, and was able to fly
home Sunday afternoon. I had indeed almost OD'd on martinis, so I heeded my
stomach's message and never had another one.

<p>A monumental tragedy occurred in May, 1977, the Beverly Hills fire. We had
been there many times to see various entertainers, like Peggy Lee, John
Davidson, Ray Charles, and had been there one week before the fire. The Club
burned to the ground, killing 165 people. We knew several of the dead. One of
them was Jim Phelps who was Tom and Dan's little league baseball coach. He
went back into the burning building several times, rescuing many people, but
did not come out the last time. Others lost were Monica and Jim Lyons, who
left five children as orphans. The kids were split up among several families.
The club was never rebuilt, and law suits continued for years. One problem
with the club was that it was like a maze to go through. Apparently when there
was illegal gambling there until the 60's, the maze made it hard for raiding
cops to get to the gambling action, allowing time for the proprietors to stash
incriminating evidence. ((Did I describe my 1957 0r58 visit with Tito
Carinci?))

<p>In December, Vic Magary, Charlie Stephens, Garv McClain and I took the very
first ACOG recertification exam. In fact, we were the only ones in greater
Cincinnati to take it. Vic was the first to finish, and told me later that he
had studied only the practice exam which had been sent out to us 3 months
previously. Fortunately for Vic, the actual re-cert exam was an exact duplicate
of the practice one. Having only looked at the practice test briefly, it took
me the entire allotted 3 hours, and I barely finished on time. It was to be my
very last ob/gyn exam.

<p>In 1978, I took a Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) course at Christ
Hospital, which I found useful on one occasion. Larry, Vic and I often went
out to lunch between office hours, and one day Vic and I went to the Town and
Country Restaurant in Ft. Wright. While waiting for our lunch, Vic mentioned
that someone in the place might be having a heart attack. I ran over, and
found a guy lying on the floor, unresponsive. This was before 911, so I asked
that the "Life Squad" be called, and started CPR on my own. No one else was
familiar with the technique, so I gave both mouth to mouth and chest
compression by myself. The squad finally arrived, and we got the patient into
the very outdated ambulance - it was actually a converted hearse. Neither
ambulance attendant helped with the CPR, so I continued to do both while en
route to SEMC North in Covington, around 10 minutes away. John Sherman, the ER
doc and I worked on the guy, got him breathing and he had a heartbeat. John
told me I saved his life, but he died a week later. There was a nice note of
appreciation from the family in the local paper, but with a little luck, he
might have made it. For some reason, Kathy and I went to the same restaurant
for dinner 2 weeks later, and we noticed that a women had passed out and
wasn't responding - I couldn't believe it. I casually walked over, and she was
breathing ok and had a normal pulse. She woke up a few minutes later,
apparently having fainted. Trying to find out what was going on, she finally
admitted that she had donated blood that morning, and had eaten nothing since.
The owner recognized me from the earlier episode, and gave me a half bottle of
wine in appreciation.

<p>The big news in '79 was Larry Hiltz stopping OB and doing office "work"
only. Vic and I then went port and starboard (on call every other night). We
then recruited Pam Hodges fresh from residency at UK. Having a female partner
was a big boon to our practice, and Pam seemed to fit in. She did tubal
ligations at St. Lukes and Bethesda, a service we needed. I also started doing
tubals at St. Lukes, on patients having repeat Cesarean sections. Pam and I
had similar styles of management, so it made our practice more coherent than
it had been.

<p>The 80's were busy times for all of us. Laurie graduated from Beechwood HS
and started at UK. Lots of kids from NKY there, looks like she feels at home.
With Dan in high School at St. X, Kathy decided to get out of the house and
pursue some further education. She started in the MBA program at XU, focusing
on Health Care, and got her MBA in May 18, 1981. She landed a great job at
Bethesda, as Manager of Government Relations.

<p>We lucked out with free summer vacations, the family driving down to
surgeon Ed Humpert's great beach house in Myrtle Beach. We did this for
several years, until on day Ed complained that I was not referring him many
patients. Although I had taken care of his wife for several years, apparently
the payback was not being met. His attitude bugged me, He sold his beach
house, and our free beach vacations came to a halt.

<p>Kathy and I took some horseback lessons in Winton Woods but I never got
the hang of achingly being bumping up and down in the saddle, and getting
almost motion sick during the ride.

<p>The premed/dent XU graduates held the first annual Fr. Joe Peters dinner in
1980. (actually 1979 was the first one) I loved these get togethers with old
buddies Matt Gorham, Pete Carroll, Chuck Schindller, Ron Borer. We did these
for 4-5 years, and stopped when Fr. Peters developed Alzheimer's. What irony -
the guy worked on nervous systems of salamanders and chicks for decades, and
then developed the worst possible neurological degenerative disease himself.
We tried to continue the meetings, using continuing education for a draw, but
it didn't work out. I continually suggested that we have sessions on medical
ethics to such a point that Borer accused me of being hung-up on ethics - what
me hung-up on ethics?

<p>I was asked to work in the UC Colposcopy clinic by the UC OB/Gyn chair, Dr.
Sam Seeds. I did two sessions. But I was going on my afternoons off, and Vic
Magary became sore about it for some reason. Also, the sessions weren't that
exciting, so my brief return to academia was placed on hold.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">1981</h1>

<p>On May 18, Kathy got her MBA from XU and landed a great job at Bethesda
Hospital as Manager of Government Relations.

<p>In early 1982 I delivered Pam Hodges in January. Afterwards, she paid me
the ultimate obstetrician's complement, saying "I don't know what your
suturing technique is, but I didn't feel anything." This comment
notwithstanding, she left our group in April, claiming that she was bringing
in more money than I was. My conservative approach to gyn surgery meant that I
was trying all nonsurgical measures for gynecologic problems, and operating
more or less as a last resort and/or when the patient demanded surgery. Maybe
I was just becoming lazier? Was I just too tired to spend many hours in the
operating room. Was I just getting older or was something else going on in my
brain? So Vic and I went back to every other night call, until Jeff Gochoel
joined us in July. Jeff trained at Bethesda in Cincinnati, and he worked right
in. He did have an interesting family history of colon polyps and cancer, and
he had a prophylactic colectomy at an early age. He was a good guy with a
great sense of humor.

<p>On April 28, Fr.Dan Berrigan was in town, speaking at the cathedral. He
mockingly referred to the St. Xavier sports nickname as "Bombers." I presented
him with the birthday card which had been returned to us when he was in prison
in 1970 for major antiwar activity, like pouring cow's blood bombs or
something. He seemed a little brusque at the time, but he remains one of my
heroes, and is certainly one of the few authentic modern prophets.

<p>((Patrick graduated from St. X in May)).

<p>On May 20 I presented a paper to the Cincinnati Obstetrical and Gynecologic
Society: "Cryosurgery in Private Practice." Despite this, they allowed me to
become a member.

<p>When Larry Hiltz retired, our relationship with him was quite strained so
we got some new legal and legal and financial people for the practice. Bill
Robinson and Dick Rankin begin as attorney and auditor for practice, and both
became good friends.

<p>1983: the highlight of the year was an all day April tour of the Napa
Valley wine country with Mike and Kathy Wulfhorst. This included stops at
Mondavi and Stering wineries.

<p>Tom graduated from St. X, receiving a special band award.

<p>Lasers were becoming popular for treatment of just about everything, and I
took a basic laser course at the University of Chicago. This included some
material on colposcopy. During one of these sessions, I asked about the need
for a certain procedure - endocervical curettage, during pregnancy. I
described a case of a pregnant woman in our practice who had an abnormal pap
smear evaluation by one of my partners (Hodges). She did this technique on a
16 weeks pregnant patient, who bled and then miscarried. It was my contention
that this technique should not be done during pregnancy. On the way out of
this session, who should be waiting but Dr. Hodges herself, appearing very
flustered. I had not known that she was attending the conference. Needless to
say, we did meet her for dinner that evening.

<p>In 1984, I went to the city of London, Ontario Canada, for a teaching
session on cervical laser in Canada with Dr. Cecil Wright, whom I had met in
Chicago. After practicing on cow uteri, I started doing cervical laser at
Bethesda and at St. Luke. The procedure was for cases of premalignant cervical
lesions. In the past, most of these patients would have required a cervical
conization, not a very good operation, since 20% of patients had severe
bleeding post op. I would later been doing these at SEMC, the first ob/gyn to
do them at that hospital.

<p>Dan graduates from St. X. White water raft trip to New River.

<p>May 6 of 84: Laurie graduated from UK. The summer before, she had an
internship at local TV Channel, earning some credits for a special (in What?)

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">1985</h1>

<p>I had always wanted to Scuba dive, and early in 1985 I started taking scuba
lessons. <br/>But I was apparently not in good enough shape, and almost
drowned during my sixth lesson. I had never been able to float, so I assumed
that my legs were just not strong enough for scuba-ing. Or was I just getting
to old for it? Were all those years of night call taking their toll? Was
something else going on?

<p>In June, I took an "open" laparoscopy course in Chicago, and did a few of
these each yea r. Later, took a Microsurgery course in New Jersey. It seemed
to improve my surgical technique doing gyn, but I realized that I would
probably not be using it for tubal surgery. On the first day of the course, we
were instructed not to drink alcohol or coffee. Unfortunately, I did both, and
could my obvious shaking under the operating microscope.

<p>Early in the year, Joyce Magary met with Kathy and me to tell us about
husband Vic's heavy drinking. Joyce and their 6 kids had a meeting with a
psychologist, and everyone agreed that Vic had a major drinking problem. This
was surprising to me, since I had never seen him drunk. The therapist thought
that we needed some definite evidence of his drinking before having an
intervention. Finally, we had solid evidence, one with him missing a delivery
after he couldn't wake up, and in the same, a doctor telling me that he saw
Vic drunk at a party, while he was on call. So, on Friday, July 11, 1985, we
had an intervention for him. This was one of the most grueling, wrenching 4
hours I had ever gone through. It almost failed - at one point, he and I got
into an argument, but the psychologist got us settled down. Vic agreed to 6
weeks hospitalization in Cincinnati. So I was on call every other night again,
and had to cancel his surgical cases, etc. This seemed to work, and he
appeared to be in good shape.

<p>I was active professionally. In October, I attended my first Central
Association meeting in New Orleans, where I was a discussant for a
presentation on colposcopy. And in December, I spent a week with Dr. Lou
Saldana at Bethesda, trying to develop my skills in ultrasonograpy. Although
ultrasound was becoming very popular in obstetrics, I never really felt
comfortable with the technique.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">1986</h1>

<p>In January of '86, our Carribean exploration continued, with a trip to the
Cayman Islands. As usual, it was a tax-deductible meeting, this time one on
investment strategies. Had a great time, which included renting a scooter for
several open-air trips around the island. The rules of the road included
driving on the left side, which was no big deal, but there were some challenges
at intersections where I was turning.

<p>((This is in June, 1988)) the Tom and Dan brotherly love competition
continued, when both graduated from college on the same day. After attending
Dan's Miami ceremonies in Oxford, we barely had time for the drive down to
Richmond for Tom's at Eastern Kentucky. We got there just in time to see KY
Governor Wallace Wilkinson arrive by helicopter.

<p>Feb: Fr.Herr visit in Lima (?When did he die). I had several visits with
him after he was diagnosed with leukemia. At the last one, we had a nice meal
and he said a private mass for me at house. He also gave me a "general
confession," which was to be the last one of these for several years ((the
last one, through the year 2000)). His funeral was at Lima St. Rose church in
Lima, OH, ironic because of the former fierce basketball rivalry. He was a
popular guy, and the church was packed. As I sat up in the choir waiting for
the mass, especially world class author Fr. Andrew Greely's homily, I
reminisced about the old days at Delphos St. John's High School. While
thinking about Fr. Herr's methods of encouragement and stimulation, a pesky
bee landed on my arm, paused, and just as quickly flew away. Did the bee
actually look at me? Had Msgr. Herr been briefly reincarnated? The guy was
without doubt a pest, but in my case, the nagging paid off. Fortunately, the
bee, did not sting me. After the mass, I said hello to Bishop Albert
Ottenweller, a former parish priest and boy scout advisor at St. John's, whom
I hadn't seen in 20 years. I reintroduced myself, and his first words were:
"Weren't you one of the scouts who cut down all those trees in Stallkamp's
Woods?" ("The evil that men do lives after them, The good is oft interred with
their bones." (Mark Anthony, in Julius Caesar , Shakespeare, III, ii, 79)

<p>In April I went to a colposcopy conference in Boston. Went one day early to
watch the Boston Celtics, mainly Larry Bird. This was one of their greatest
teams, with Danny Ange, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson, Kevin McHale. I really
enjoyed being in the Boston Gardens.

<p>Patrick graduated from Purdue on May 18, with double majors in math and
computer science. He signed on with IBM, with whom he had co-opted the
previous year, and went to work in Lexington, KY.

<p>Also in May I was having more motion sickness and my hearing seemed worse
at times. The possibility of an acoustic neuroma (a brain tumor involving the
eighth cranial nerve) crossed my mind, so I saw Dr. Lazinski in Cincy. He
recommended a brain imaging test, but first asked what kind of insurance I
had. He said the MRI was much more expensive than a CT scan, so I got the CT.
The MRI is more sensitive, but the CT would pick up a brain tumor. As the old
joke goes, CT scan of my brain showed nothing. I was somewhat reassured, but
wondered what, if anything might be going on inside my head.

<p>In June, the labor and delivery units of SEMC were transferred from the
North Unit (Covington) to the South (Edgewood). This was much closer to home -
I could get there in 8 minutes. Also, we now had individual sleeping rooms,
compared to the old "dormitory style" quarters at the North. Joe Daugherty
would no longer keep 3 other guys awake all night with his snoring. The worst
part of the old arrangement was that whenever one person was called, we would
all wake up, so that being there meant you would most likely get no sleep. Our
practice arrangement of having the day off after being on call was essential,
just to try to catch up on missing sleep.

<p>((1986))The highlight of the year was on September 9, our Silver Wedding
Anniversary. We had a great party, and had lots of local and out of town
friends and family. Sue and Len, Uncle Tom and Aunt Pat, and Ernie and Flo
Mazzaferri were there, with Ernie giving a Best-Man's tribute. The party was
in our back yard, and a good time was had by all. 

<p>1987 was jam-packed with excitement, not all of it good.. I had a case of a
pregnant woman with an abnormal pap smear who required cervical conization, a
procedure we liked to avoid even with non-pregnant patients, because of the
potential for heavy bleeding. The "cone" was needed to rule out invasive
cervical cancer. My friendly gyn oncologist Helmut Schellhas did the
procedure. At the time, I had not thought too much about the potential ethical
ramifications involved if there was invasive disease. If indicated, would it
appropriate to do a hysterectomy, at a Catholic hospital, and thus lose the
pregnancy? I had done one of these in Charleston, but that was a naval
hospital. I uses the case as my presentation for the July trip to the then
Soviet Union (USSR). I was a member of a group of OB/GYNs who represented the
People to People organization. This was when the Soviet Union was just
starting to open up. But the Cold War was still officially going on, as we
found out on our first day in that Communist state.

<p>Our 2 week trip started in Helsinki, Finland. This was a friendly, quiet
and pleasant country which featured a lot of reindeer meat. After a few days,
we left for Leningrad (later to be re-named St. Petersburg). Immediately upon
arrival, we watched as our American interpreter was led away to be questioned
by uniformed personnel. We did not see him again until 12 hours later. As part
of his luggage, he had brought in several large packages, which he told
everyone that this was stereo equipment for some soviet friends. The military
confiscated this stuff, and this put a damper on the rest of the trip. I was
convinced that he really was some kind of a CIA operative, and I mentioned
this fact in my evaluation to the trip sponsors. We did not visit any Russian
homes, and were not permitted to give our presentations until the last day.
Before that, we went to several circuses in Leningrad and Moscow, as well as
the Hermitage, an awesome museum. Things were worse in Moscow, and we were not
able to enter any of the night spots there until the night before we left. Our
lodgings in Moscow were at the huge one block square Russia Hotel, where I
asked about laundry facilities. I was told to leave my dirty shirts in the
hotel room, and someone would take care of them. When I returned to my room
later on, there was a maid washing my shirts in our bathtub - they didn't have
any laundry facilities. We did tour their largest women's hospital, which
appeared to be on a par with a 1940's American hospital. They had open air
delivery and surgical suites, and I noticed lots of flies coming in the open
window. Their blood bank was pitiful, having only one unit of each blood type
for the entire institution. They hastened to explain that needed blood could
sometimes be obtained from other hospitals, within a matter of hours. I did
taste caviar for the first time, washing it down with warm beer. The last leg
of the trip was 3 days in Stockholm Sweden, a very pleasant place. When we
landed in New York, everyone stood up and applauded - we felt very fortunate
and proud to be American citizens.

<p>Later in the year, I agreed to be an "expert witness" for Charlie Stephen's
malpractice suit. Tohis was my first appearance in a court room and it was
awful. The case involved a surgical case, in which the ureter was mistakenly
tied off during a hysterectomy. This is a potential complication with any
hysterectomy, and I had one in a case of my own one year previously. I was on
the witness stand for several grueling hours, and we were all surprised when
Charlie lost the case.

<p>After he was diagnosed with metastatic stomach cancer, I reconciled my
relationship with former partner Larry Hiltz. We had been on bad terms since
before his retirement, when there was too much discussion about his worth to
the practice and financial matters. I did visit him several times, the last in
the hospice unit. He was losing touch, and talked about his being a pro
football player. He died on December 8. We all knew Vic Magary was taking
Larry's death very hard, but no one could have predicted how hard that would
be.

<p>The week before the Christmas of '87, Vic met with Jeff and me, and
admitted that he had fallen off the wagon - he had taken "a few" drinks. His
psychologist would be meeting with Vic the day after Christmas. As it turned
out, that would not be soon enough. Just after our Christmas dinner, Jeff
called to say that Vic had stabbed his oldest son, John. When I got to Vic's
house, he was being led away in handcuffs by the police, while the life squad
was taking a shocky John Magary to SEMC South. Jeff had followed the
ambulance, and I joined him and surgeon George Renaker in the OR with John for
a 3 hour exploratory operation. John had bowel lacerations and lost one
kidney, but he survived. Before going into the OR, I had called our attorney
Bill Robinson. Vic spent a few hours in jail, then was transferred to the
psychiatric unit at St. E North. Vic was finally correctly diagnosed with
manic depression (bipolar), and would spend 3 months in Harding Psychiatric
Institute. in Columbus, Ohio. He would never practice medicine again.

<p>After Vic's "retirement," Jeff and I were back to being on call other
night. Mike Lavender and Garry Kanter helped by cross-covering with us, so it
could have been worse. I did not especially like either one of these guys, but
it sure beat port and starboard night call - I was getting too old for that.

<p>((?Delete this paragraph((?88))In March, the NCAA regional basketball
tournament came to Cincy. I had previously entered a ticket lottery, and
luckily, I won tickets for the 2 days of non-stop college basketball. Kathy
was not interested, so Jeff and I went one day, and old XU buddy Neil Mooney
came up from Bristol Tennessee for the second day. We watched something like
12 games in two days, even going to practice day to see Indiana's coach Bobby
Knight perform. I loved all of it)).

<p>The next month, I had my toughest delivery ever. The patient had 3 previous
deliveries, her last one being a 10 pounder. But this one was bigger - 11.5
lbs, requiring a difficult mid forceps procedure. The baby had a 0 Apgar at
birth, but was finally resuscitated. It was transferred to Children's Hospital
immediately, where it stayed for several weeks. At her postpartum six weeks
checkup, the mother told me that the baby was slowly improving. But I would
hear much more about this case in the future.

<p>In May, 1988, our college bills ceased, as Tom and Dan graduated. Dan's was
early AM. We heard the editor of National Geographic give an acceptable
commencement address, and hung around in Oxford long enough to be sociable. We
then raced down to Richmond KY just in time to get to Tom's ceremony at EKU,
with KY Governor Wallace Wilkenson arriving in a helicopter to do the talk.

<p>In May, Dr. Frank Chervenak gave the OB/GYN Grand Rounds Lecture at UC, on
obstetric ethics. I was fascinated by the topic, and asked him after the
lecture how I could get more info on the topic. His advice was to read the
"Hastings Center Report," the only ethics journal available at the time. I had
previously subscribed to the magazine in the late 70's, but canceled it
because I rarely read any of the articles. Since I was resuming my interest in
ethics, I also resumed my subscription.

<p>On July 12, Cincinnati was host for the Major League All-Star game. I got
two $30.00 tickets, and Tom and I went to see a somewhat boring pitcher's
dual, ending in a 1-0 score. We had a good time anyway, but I don't remember
who won the game.

<p>Kathy and I went to the Central Association of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists meeting in September, held in Salt Lake City. After the meeting,
I went on a 3 day white water raft trip down the Utah portion of the Colorado
River. On the second day, we spotted a guy walking along the river bank with a
shotgun. He looked and talked like a hill-person and I uncomfortably
remembered the movie "Deliverance," where the canoeists were assaulted by some
Georgia hill people. The guy just asked for some tobacco, and raft master just
went close enough to shore to throw him some, and then got the hell out of
there ASAP. We were told later that it was illegal to carry firearms in the
area, but we heard nothing further from the guy or any of his companions. My
luck was holding. As it turned out, the weather also held, and the trip was
great. But being out in the sun on warm days was very tiring, and I was
exhausted when I got home. And I still watch "Deliverance" every time it's on
TV.

<p>In December I was having some numbness and decreased sensation in my left
hand, and called primary care doc Roy Moser, who opined that it was likely
either cervical arthritis or multiple sclerosis, and advised me to see
neurologist, Scott Heath. The sensation was diminished to a point that I had
to do pelvic exams with my right hand, which was very disconcerting, almost
like being a med student again. An MRI of my neck showed severe cervical
arthritis, and I started home cervical traction, or as Heath described it,
we'll make you taller. After 6 weeks there was no improvement, so I saw Lowell
Ford, a neurosurgeon, who scheduled a myelogram, looking for a surgical
condition. The day before the myelogram, things seemed "miraculously" better,
so I was spared the procedure. Ford's diagnosis was carpal tunnel syndrome. I
doubted this diagnosis, but since things had improved, I did nothing else at
the time.

<h1 class="page-break">1989 - An Extremely Big Year</h1>

<p>In February, I attended an SEMC Workshop in ethics. The conference was
aimed at MDs, RNs, and other professional people. There were no terribly
earth-shattering presentations, but it did whet my appetite somewhat, and I
was wondering if there might be something in it for me. Coincidentally (?), I
soon learned of another ethics conference at Christ Hospital, scheduled for
April. Although scheduled to work, I persuaded a reluctant Gary Kant4er to
cover for me so I could attend at least part of the session. The featured
speaker was Stuart Youngner, a psychiatrist at Case Western, who was a dynamic
speaker. Ethics was becoming more interesting, and I spoke with him briefly
after his talk. He was very friendly, and promised to send me info on the the
Society for Bioethics Consultation, which would be meeting in the fall.

<p>((INTERCONNECTEDNESS)) Jim Regan - BENO - Bob Baumiller - Also at SBC: met
Bob Orr, Jim Drane, Chris McHenry, Mark Siegler. Siegler suggested meeting
Terry Perlin - Bob McLauren - Cris McHenry - Mary Mahowald. Jim Drane - later
Drane introduced me to Stephen Post as a potential Union adjunct. McHenry - UC
first year course in Health Care Ethics - intro to Interactive Method)).

<p>Shortly after the Christ Hospital conference, Kathy showed me an article in
the Kentucky Post which featured a guy who had just received a masters degree
in bioethics from Georgetown University, and was doing ethics consultations
for hospitals. Kathy remarked: "You could do that." - Why not? The very next
week I was paging through the ads in the JAMA, and something jumped out at me:
a notice of Georgetown's annual Intensive Bioethics Course, scheduled for the
summer of '89. I sent in my application for the course, was accepted, and soon
received 3 ethics books in the mail which were to be read in advance of the
course.

<p>In the meantime, my left foot was becoming even more painful, and I
consulted my Podiatrist Gary Neltner, who told me I was essentially walking on
a spur, like a thorn in my foot, and would need major foot surgery, requiring
being off work for 4-6 weeks. I got a second opinion from orthopedic foot
specialist Jim Sammarco. He also advised a "big" operation, essentially
rebuilding my foot. He said I would need to be off work for 8 weeks, and might
have pain and swelling for up to one year after surgery. Since we still had a
two-man practice, I told him that this was totally unacceptable. He finally
decided on a more conservative procedure, in which only the end of the
affected bone would be excised, and I could be back to work in 2 weeks. This
seemed more rational, and I had the surgery on April 27. I used the time off
to read one of the Georgetown books - "Principles of Biomedical Ethics," by
two Georgetown ethicists. The course was June 18-24, and I was hooked! It
really was intense, but I enjoyed it, and got so involved that I met with the
course director, LeRoy Walters, to discuss my enrolling in the Masters degree
program in bioethics. The week was also a good family one, since Pat and Sandy
and Dan were all living in the D.C. area, and we got together for a nice
cruise on the Potomac. I had definitely decided that my second career was
going to be in bioethics, but I was not sure how I was going to get there.

<p>The Ethics Scene was now evolving fast and furious. In September, I went to
a Society for Bioethics Consultation conference in St. Louis. I met some good
people from the University of Chicago Center for Clinical Ethics, including
the head, Dr. Mark Siegler, an internist world class ethicist. I talked to
several of the Chicago Fellows, and at that point, I was trying to decide
between the Georgetown Masters Bioethics program and the University of Chicago
fellowship in clinical ethics. In the meantime, I asked the SEMC Ethics
Committee Chair Rose Hook about being a member. It happened that one member,
Dr. Ralph Huller, was leaving the committee, and I was appointed to take his
place. My first meeting was in September. One of my first committee projects
was to work on a position paper on fetal anencephaly. In this condition, the
fetus has a an undeveloped, almost absent brain. It can be diagnosed very
early in pregnancy, and is always fatal. At the time, it was believed that
there was great risk for severe maternal emotional problems. And since the
deformity is always lethal, our committee's position was that early induction
of labor, even before fetal viability, could be appropriate.

<p>Kathy and I had the "winning" bid in a trip to Spain, which we took in
September. It was our first trip to Europe, and we rented a car and visited
Ronda with its Roman bridges, Granada with its Islamic culture, and the rock
of Gibralter. On the way back, we spent one night in London and had a brief
midnight tour of the city's sites. We found the British to be more friendly
than the Spanish. ((EMBELLISH this - Bullfight, food, etc))

<p>1990 was to be a benchmark year, in many ways. ((Professionally, I had my
only Triplet delivery - used IV alcohol ((Later in year, after Vince starts))
The practice was becoming hi-tech - because of the multiple health plans and
HMO's, we computerized the office, just to keep track of all of the paperwork.
And Jeff and I purchased a cell phone, which we shared when on call. It was
neat, but did not work inside of buildings, such as the hospital.

<p>((Marco: you need to get another degree))I recognized a need to expand my
ethics knowledge base. After looking at XU's minimal offerings in philosophy
courses, I took old buddy Matt Gorham's suggestion and inquired into the
University of Cincinnati's programs. In January, I met with the UC philosophy
department chairman who suggested that I take a graduate level ethics course
which featured John Rawls' "A Theory of Justice." I started the class 2 weeks
late, and it took the rest of the quarter to catch up. I felt a little out of
place with the young philosophy majors, and fortunately, their were no exams.
I did a 25 page final essay which considered whether health care should be
considered a basic right for Americans: "Some Ethical Considerations of Health
Care Allocation. This was my first essay in over 30 years, it was lot of work,
with 51 references, and thought it deserved an A. But the professor, David
Anderson, a visiting fellow from University of Michigan, thought otherwise,
and gave me a B for the essay and the course. His main criticism of the paper
was that the discussion was not sufficiently analytical. I had no idea what
that meant. Fortunately, he probably realized that, and explained it in his
page-long critique of the essay: "Analysis means breaking down the components
of the problem in order to illuminate the question at issue." That made some
sense, and would prove to be helpful for future work in philosophy.

<p>In February, Kathy and I took a break from the awful weather for a week
long trip to the wonderful Caribbean island of St.Martens. We loved these
islands, which were fairly low-key, with friendly natives, great restaurants,
and perfect weather. Our beachside cabin was great, but to my surprise, I got
sunburned in the shade, from reflection off the water.

<p>Later on at home, I was watching a pro basketball game on TV, when Mark
Kemen, Laurie's boyfriend came in to the family room to talk. He was speaking
very softly, and I told him to hold on, and I would turn down the volume of
the game. But when I caught the word "married," I turned off the game
completely. In an old-fashioned way, he was asking for Laurie's hand in
marriage. Our only daughter was getting engaged!

<p>In May, we went to another medical meeting, this time the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in San Francisco, one of our favorite
cities, hooking up with old friends from residency, Ernie and Jean Wood. I
took a postgraduate course in OB ethic, but I didn't learn much of anything
new. I guess that was a good sign, maybe I had already learned a few things. I
had some conversations with the courser director, Tom Elkins, from Michigan,
who would later face great problems after he became department chair at LSU in
New Orleans. The night before I left San Francisco, I was exhausted, and had
to cancel a dinner date with the Woods.

<p>Dr. Mark Siegler had suggested that I meet with Dr. Terry Perlin, an
ethicist at Miami University in Oxford, and we met on May 24. The same day,
Perlin introduced me to Dr. Bob McLauren, a Cincinnati neurosurgeon and
attorney. Bob invited me to a Children's Hospital ethics conference later in
the year, where I met Dr. Chris McHenry, a pediatrician in charge of the UC
ethics course for first year medical students. Chris asked me to be a
facilitator for the course. This involved having small group student sessions,
which used the interactive method, where the students were supposed to do most
of the work. Was all this serendipitous or not?

<p>The next week I flew up to Chicago to meet with Mark Siegler at the U
Chicago Center for Clinical Ethics, to discuss their one year fellowship
program. It sounded great to me, and it paid a stipend of ?$20,000 for the
year. I also talked with Dr. Arthur Herbst, chair of OB/GYN at UChi, who was
the leader for our trip to the Soviet Union in 19--. He was very helpful, but
did ask me what would become of my private practice. Good question - I had not
thought too much about that, but it would depend on the prospects for a
clinical ethicist/obstetrician/gynecologist, of whom there were possibly 2 or
3 in the USA. In Chicago, I also met up with old buddy and cousin Bob Kill,
who had become a very successful businessman. We toured the Art Museum and had
a good visit, but I was exhausted when I got home.

<p>In early June, I developed severe low back pain during a C-Section. I was
able to finish the case, but was walking bent over. I talked to orthopedist
Gordon Air who advised me to take 2 hot baths and call him in the morning. He
examined me the next day, found nothing, and since I was feeling better, we
did not pursue it. The next day, Jeff Gochoel left for a well-deserved 2 week
vacation in California. We had some emergency backup from Mike Lavender and
Gary Kanter, but I was to be virtually in solo practice for the next 14 days.
In addition to being on call every night for the next 14 days, there were busy
office hours. I had an eerie feeling that the sky might fall in when Jeff took
off, and it did!

<p>On the very first day, June 6, I was swamped right off the bat, having 6
deliveries in 8 hours, including 2 C sections. Several of the deliveries were
bunched together, which I hated. I really did not like to be forced to work
too fast, but there was no one available whom I could call to help. The next
day was less busy, but I got caught in a traffic jam and was late for office
hours. Another labor call brought me to the hospital at midnight. Fortunately,
the delivery at 5 AM was fairly easy. But I was having a recurrence of the
numbness and decreased sensation in my left hand, and called the office of
neurologist Scott Heath and left a message. Scott was on vacation, but his
partner Jim Farrell called me and advised coming to the office later that day.
My own office hours started at 9, and I was surprised to find Farrell there
waiting for me. He was concerned that I might be having a stroke or a heart
attack, so he made a "house call" to check me out. He elicited some
hyperactive reflexes, but everything else was ok. I felt comfortable with Jim
in all respects - technically, intellectually, and emotionally. He ordered a
neck MRI later that day, but it was unchanged from the prior one of 1988. The
business continued over the weekend, and at one point I was nauseated from
exhaustion. By Monday morning I had survived after doing my 10th delivery in
7 days. I was hanging in there, but had some disturbing new symptoms: a lot of
weakness in my legs, and Kathy noticed one side of my face was drooping, a sign
of facial muscle problems. I went to Farrell's office and he confirmed the new
findings. His impression was some kind of major neuromuscular problem, such as
multiple sclerosis (MS) or myasthenia gravis. MRI the next day confirmed the
diagnosis: MS. I was not too surprised. I struggled through the next few days.
I felt insecure, and felt the need to share the news with friends John Darpel
and Charlie Stephens, who agreed to back me up at the hospital, at any time.
Fortunately, deliveries were mercifully slow, but my left hand was weak and
clumsy during laser cervical surgery, I was having trouble tying knots and
putting in my hearing aid and with word processor typing. I felt generally
weak and shaky, and cancelled some office patients, for the first time in my
career. Kathy was giving me great support during this hectic time. I was
wondering what would happen to me, the family, the practice, life. She assured
me that things would somehow work out for the best.

<p>I had a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to confirm the diagnosis, and was then
given IV SoluMedrol (corticosteroids), trying to stop the acute process. It
worked. I felt great almost immediately, with more energy, strength, and
improved symptoms. But I was having trouble sleeping, and had developed a
severe headache. The brain MRI had also shown acute sinusitis, so I treated
myself, as usual, with antibiotics. Farrell thought I might have a spinal
headache and might need an epidural patch. (?how many spinal headaches had my
own OB patients had).

<p>Jeff finally got back to work on Monday, and I broke him the news. We had a
business meeting with Gradison in the afternoon, which I had to leave because
of the awful headache. I went to the ER for the epidural patch, and at one
point had 3 different needles sticking in me: the epidural, the venipunture to
get my blood for the patch, and the IV needle, for my last SoluMedrol
treatment. Jeff visited me, and I joked that with all of the needles, maybe
this would be a good time for acupuncture.

<p>Our new partner Vince Lubrano came on board in July, and he was a sight for
sore eyes (as well as sore backs, necks, heads, and brains. Vince was a hybrid
or mongrel in many ways - a red-head with an Irish mother and Italian father,
who grew up in Brooklyn, moved to Texas, going to Texas A&amp;M for college
and med school, and took his ObGyn residency at Medical College of Ohio in
Toledo. So we welcomed this transmigrated tough-talking but gentle
Italian/Irish Brooklynite/Aggy/Ohioan to the Northern Kentucky. I had told him
up-front when the MS was diagnosed, and he seemed comfortable with that. He
was also aware of Jeff's family history of colon cancer, but none of our
rotten medical situations seemed to bother him. Seemed like a cool guy, with a
?gift for gab. When he first visited us looking at the practice, he remarked
that one thing he liked about Jeff and me was that we didn't wear wristwatches
at our first dinner together. Did we not want to feel that our pleasantries
would be constrained by the time factor? Or maybe we had just lost too many
watches, left in our scrub clothes at the hospital? For some reason, he was
impressed, and accepted our overly generous financial offer. My own salary and
work schedule was renegotiated to accommodate my need to avoid fatigue. I
would take one week off each month, and my paycheck would reflect the
decreased work load.

<p>Earnie Mazzaferri was still Chairman of Internal Medicine at OSU, and he
suggested I see Dr. Romahan, their MS specialist for another opinion. He
agreed with the diagnosis, but had nothing to offer regarding management.
There was no specific treatment for MS back in 1990. Of special concern was my
fluctuating energy levels, which made long days in the office and night call
frustrating. Jim Farrell had prescribed amandtadine for the fatigue, which did
not help. So I had to adjust the office schedule, and would call for help at
night when needed.

<p>It was becoming obvious that my days as a practicing Ob/Gyn were probably
numbered, and some hard decisions would need to be made about a possible
second career in ethics. Old mentor Marco Labudovitch from residency days in
San Diego had said that I would need "an advanced degree" of some kind. My
preference was either the masters program in bioethics at Georgetown, or Mark
Siegler's fellowship in clinical ethics at U Chicago. I really did not want to
go out of town for an entire year, so I talked to Dr. Dick Gruber at XU, about
their MA Humanities program. At that point, it was becoming obvious to me that
modern bioethics was too complicated for just a philosophical or theological
approach, and required an integrated, more holistic background. A solid
foundation in humanities looked like a good place to start, and being in the
program would allow me the time to make a decision whether further eduction
was indicated. I could also get some exposure to some subjects which I didn't
have much time for during my undergrad years. School commenced on September 5,
1990. (?list some courses)

<p>I resumed my XU career with 3 courses: one in English literature which
included some poetry. The prof was my age who had also had Fr. Joe Peters, my
old mentor at XU, for Biology. The other course was a history seminar which
focused on English and American heroes. These included Achilles in the Iliad,
the Aneid, Bodachea Henry V, George Washington, Florence Nightingale, Charles
Lindbergh, and some Irish guys, members of the original IRA. Mercifully, there
were no written or oral exams, but the several essays required were a real
grind. I thought most of them were well done, but earned only one A out of 6
for the course. Dr. Gruber did spend some extra time with me, trying to
sharpen my writing skills, but I did not give him what he wanted on his
specialty, Irish history. I thought his Irish "heroes" were pretty pathetic,
and to a large extent responsible for the ongoing modern violence in Northern
Ireland. I would get only Bs from his 3 history courses. It probably didn't
help my cause to present him with a non-derogatory personalized limerick at
final class, although he seemed to enjoy it.

<p>Other courses at XU: Theory of Knowledge - first day of class, Prof asked
if anyone had taken a metaphysics course. One sweet young thing admitted she
had, but it had been almost 3 years since the course. I was too embarrassed to
admit that it had been 35 years since my own metaphysics course with good old
bad Dr. Bernard Gendreau. My final essay was "Conscience as Consciousness," in
which I tried to show how conscience and its development was an example of how
the conscious state might function. Also took some individualized bioethics
courses with Christine Godorf. One of the more enjoyable courses was Modern
Drama, where we read GB Shaw, Chekov, Ibssen. My final essay looked at "Death
of a Salesman" and its ethical overtones. I also tried to get credit for the
acting classes I took at the Playhouse in the Park, but Gruber turned me down.

<p>My master's dissertation was "Religious Reasons for Refusal of Medical
Treatment." An example was Jehova's Witnesses (JW) refusal of life-saving
blood transfusions. Coincidentally, the local paper ran an article about a JW
woman who bled heavily after delivery, was transferred to UC, received all
kinds of treatments including hyperbaric chamber, but died of profound
anemia. She essentially bled to death, having refused blood transfusions which
would have saved her life. The family was so suspicious that they posted
someone in her room at all times, just to prevent someone sneaking in a pint
of blood. I knew the obstetrician, and called him after learning of the case.
He was devastated about the death. I tried to be conciliatory, but also
offered my own approach to the JW problem. When JW patients come in for their
first prenatal visit, I tell them that I respect their decision to refuse
blood. But I would like them to also respect my own decision, that I would
have a moral obligation to save their life, even if it would involve a blood
transfusion. If they do not accept this proposal, they are free to transfer to
another obstetrician. Fortunately, in there is no shortage of Ob/Gyns in the
Greater Cincy area.

<p>I had formulated this approach a few years previously, after an experience
with one of my own JW patients. She had a normal delivery, but bled heavily
the following day. Kathy and I were in Covington furniture shopping, when I
got a call on my newly-acquired beeper. Fortunately, we were still doing OB at
St. E's North in Covington, so Kathy dropped me off at the hospital. The
patient was hemorrhaging, and it was obvious that she needed an emergency
hysterectomy. Before starting the surgery, I ordered the patient to be given 2
units of non-crossmatched blood. The anesthesiologist questioned this, asking:
"Is this a wise thing to do? She is a Jehovah's Witness, and also has an
increased chance of having a reaction to this kind of blood." I said: "This
patient is in shock. If you don't give the blood and she dies, it's your
fault." The doctor gave the blood, the hysterectomy was done rapidly, the
patient had no further problems, and never questioned receiving blood. The
uterus showed that the placenta had invaded into the uterus, (placenta
accreta), and hysterectomy is the only treatment. I had gone over all of this
before surgery, and repeated it post-op, and the patient and her husband did
not question the transfusion. But I decided I needed to better inform these
patients, and so decided on the above pro-active approach.

<p>I was making some helpful local connections with ethics people. Nationally
known ethicist Terry Perlin at Miami U. had introduced me to Bob neurosurgeon/
lawyer Bob McLauren, who invited me to a Children's Hospital ethics conference
on Sept. 14. Pediatrician and ethicist Chris McHenry saw me in the parking lot
and asked me to be a facilitator for the UC ethics course for first year
medical students. This involves tutoring small groups of students, and proved
to be a great educational tool, mainly for me in the first few years of my
introduction to this teaching method.

<p>On September 10, I gave my very first ethics lecture, for the Family
Practice Residents at SEMC. The title was "Perinatal Ethics," but what
material I actually covered, I have no idea. (?See old notes from outline in
Q&amp;A)

<p>In October I attended an ethics course at Mt. Carmel Hospital in Columbus,
site of my old intern stomping grounds. When I walked through the hospital
doors, I wondered whether how much of my intern work was ethically
appropriate. Other than doing a lot of the usual practicing on patients, I
could not put my finger on any profound ethical dilemma from this part of my
life. The draw for me at this conference was the great Jesuit Fr. Richard
McCormick, world class ethicist from Notre Dame, and whom I had talked with
previously about the anencephaly issue. I had written to him regarding the
situation, and he later telephoned me with some excellent advice. After his
presentation, I introduced myself, and we had a friendly and informative chat.
As I was leaving, we shook hands, and he thanked me for saying hello! Is that
super-friendly or what?

<p>Christmas 1990, I volunteered to work the day, feeling that this would
probably be my last Christmas on call, and that my partners might not get many
of the holidays off in the foreseeable future. There is no memory of any
catastrophic cases.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">1991</h1>

<p>In February, Kathy and I had a great trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba
for the Christ Hospital Annual Continuing Education Seminar, and I was on the
program, giving my first non-obstetric ethics lecture - "Everyday Ethics in
Medical Practice." (Check program in closet or Q&amp;A Notes for content) As
far as I could tell, it appeared to be well-received. An old classmate from
XU, Al Huesman, a nerdy Cincy family doctor, did pay me what I considered the
ultimate complement: "Fr. Peters would have been very proud of you, Bud!" The
vacation also gave me time to consider my situation, whether I should retire
from practice sooner rather than later. My comfort level doing OB and surgery
was not too great. From an ethical view, might I cause undo harm to a patient?
I did enjoy office work, but the "magic touch" of my fingers was just not
there anymore. I felt that my tactile pelvic exam skills were at about the
level of a first year resident. I wanted to pursue a career in ethics, but the
1991 Cincinnati offerings in this area were not very obvious. Kathy was very
supportive in all this, assuring me that she was certain that things would
work out. Attorney and friend Bill Robinson advised me on my disability
claims, which were eventually approved. I officially retired from OB/Gyn
practice on March 1, 1991.

<p>The following letter was sent to our patients:

<blockquote>
<p>To Our Patients:

<p>On March 1, 1991, I will begin an indefinite leave of absence from the
active practice of OB/Gyn. After 25 fulfilling years of obstetrics and
delivering over 7000 babies, I have made this decision with great reluctance.
Unfortunately, recent medical problems are causing me to "slow down" and to
consider developing new skills in areas other than obstetrics. Dr. Jeff
Gochoel and Dr. Vince Lubrano will continue to provide you with the excellent
medical care to which you are accustomed. As you have come to realize, you
will be in extremely capable hands with these highly talented physicians, who
are dedicated to your well-being. As I approach the challenges of the future
with determination, I will always appreciate the opportunity to have served
you these many years here in Northern Kentucky - it has been my privilege and
you have my lasting appreciation. Warmest regards,

<p>Maurice J. Mueller, M.D.
</blockquote>

<p>This letter might sound a little more flowery and flashy than my usual
fare, and it was not all my doing. Bill Robinson helped me with it. He also
advised me to not make the diagnosis of MS public - the sentiment was that if
word got out, it could work against me in any future lawsuits. It also may
have provided me a practical reason for denial of my illness. I could not have
known it at the time, but I would later be busier than I ever thought
possible.

<p>((this was mentioned previously with XU courses)) At around the same time,
I did something which I had always wanted to do. It seemed totally without
redeeming social or economic value of any kind - I took some acting classes at
the Playhouse in the Park in Cincinnati. The instructor was Sue Banks, the
sister of good friend Bill Banks who had been killed in an accident in Alaska
the previous year. Sue praised my progress, noting that my voice projected
well, and believed I might have a future in acting. In retrospect, the voice
training which I had in these classes probably helped me become a more
effective teacher.

<p>Laurie was married at Blessed Sacrament Church in Frt. Mitchell on April
27. Old buddy Fr. Bob Holden did the honors, and stayed at our house as usual.
We had offered to put him up at the local Drawbridge Motel, but he declined.
He did not want to miss all the excitement going on in the house before,
during, and after the wedding. His sermon was as usual great. The reception
was at Four Seasons country club, and turned out well, after some initial
glitches. Club management had underestimated the seating capacity, and some
guests would be seated at a distance from the festivities. Fortunately, the
Neiheisers volunteered to take these seats, and things then calmed down.

<p>((In May, I was on a panel at the SEMC Ethics Conference on "Rationing in
Health Care." I used the Oregon experience which had been implemented the
previous year.))

<p>Dr. Andy Baker at St. Elizabeth's asked me to do some medical student
teaching. I had been instrumental in getting the third year medical students
on OB/GYN at UC to do their OB rotation at SEMC. The hospital agreed to a
reimbursement arrangement of compensation, where I would receive $44 per hour,
which would be applied to ethics meetings I would attend on behalf of the
hospital. ((When did I start on the Ethics Committee? 1990?)) Eventually, Dr.
Clarence McLain at UC told me that the student sessions were well-received,
and I was asked to develop a teaching module for interactive group learning
sessions for the students on OB. I

<p>((My first session was in 1994. See my article on this for some detail;
?Describe these here))

<p>I had a gut feeling about being exposed to a maximum number of Great Minds
in Bioethics, so I applied for and was accepted to a 5 week stint as a
Visiting Scholar At the Hastings Center, an Ethics think tank outside of New
York City. I took a quarter off from the Humanities Program at XU in
September. The main focus of my "research" was Extreme Prematurity, which
includes pregnancies at 23-25 weeks gestation. Most (85-90%) of these infants
will not survive, and a high percentage of those that live will be permanently
damaged. They are at risk for severe mental retardation, paralysis, cerebral
palsy, blindness, and chronic lung disease. I presented my work at The Center
and seemed to be well received. But the Chief Honcho, world famous ethicist
Daniel Callahan didn't believe I had unearthed any new material on the
subject. It was true that there were rafts of articles concerning the
situation after birth, but very little for the obstetrician confronted with
the problem during pregnancy. Anyway, I did not fight the prevailing wisdom,
and was content with a tiny publication in the Hastings Center tiny
"CenterPiece" newsletter, of December 1991: "Extreme Prematurity: Whose
Benefits, Whose Burdens?" I ended my brief essay with the following: "We
anxiously await better knowledge about these tiny creatures. Until we have it,
however, their care should be regarded as an experimental process. Aggressive,
unproved, innovative research should be presented as an option for parents.
They are the ones who will live with the burdens and benefits of their
decision.

<p>(?possible future malpractice fallout ((at 1998 ASBH meeting in Houston))
During this time, I got together with old friends and New York natives Jack
and Eileen Benedetto a few times during my stay in New York. On Oct. 14-Hyde

<p>In early 1992 I was staying busy with XU classes and working on my master's
thesis, "Religious Reasons for Refusal of Medical Interventions." Before class
one night I ran into a guy who had been in some of my Humanities classes, and
we talked about plans after graduation. He was considering getting into the
PhD program at The Union Institute in Cincinnati. The Union was one of the
best kept secrets in town, and I, like most, had never heard of it. The idea
started as the "University Without Walls," and featured a nontraditional
program. You could actually get your doctorate without ever attending a "real"
class. I was skeptical, but intrigued with the idea, and met with Union
people. Although psychology was the most popular area, at least two persons
had received PhDs in Bioethics. At least the project would keep me more or
less busy. Besides that, my interest in ethics was continuing, and a doctorate
might give me some credibility. An alternative was the graduate program in
philosophy at UC. I did feel the need for more philosophy courses, but not
exclusively. Modern bioethics is much more than just philosophy or theology,
and I recognized the need for a broad-based multidisciplinary background. I
mentioned my plans to old friend Bob Lauer, who wanted to know just what
bioethics was. I told him it's basically the same as the old medical ethics,
that is, concerned with how the actions of health care providers effect
patients. Strictly speaking, bioethics also includes animals and plants, so I
prefer to use the term biomedical ethics, which is more or less a dressed up
version of the old medical ethics. All of this time, I was staying busy with
XU classes and work on my masters thesis, "Religious Reasons for Refusal of
Medical Interventions."

<p>In April, Kathy and I took time out for some fun, and attended accountant -
friend Dick Rankin's surprise 50th birthday party at Walt's Hitching Post
restaurant. For some reason, I decided to compose a limerick for the occasion.
It was fun doing, exercised the brain, and marked the beginning of a new
hobby. Limerick # 1:

<blockquote>
<p>Dick Rankin's 50th birthday - April 3, 1992
<p>A silver-haired CPA named Dick<br>
Was fast, fair, and slick.<br>
And as he reached fifty,<br>
He was still just as nifty.<br>
For slick Dick was still quick with his Bic.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note: a "Bic" is the trademark for a ballpoint pen, especially popular
with accountants). 

<p>Unrelatedly, the following week, I gave a lecture on "Sexually Transmitted
Diseases," for Christine Gudorf's Christian Sexual Ethics course at XU. She
had been a great mentor for my early times in bioethics, and I wanted to
return the favor. The students did not receive any basic material on this, and
I believed they needed some exposure. The talk included graphic slides of GC,
chlamydia, syphilis, wart virus, and AIDS. I had the impression that the
students did not grasp the significance of the material, and likely believed
that this stuff only happens to other people. I barely finished the slide
show, pausing to answer any and all questions as they arose. I later
suspected that the wise guy students were in the habit of asking sufficient
questions to cut down on the material for which they would be responsible for
in future exams. It would be my last XU lecture for quite awhile.

<p>In May, I graduated from XU, getting a MA in Humanities, 34 years after my
BS. I enjoyed the program, especially the humanities and literature courses.
Being not one for standing on ceremony, I did not attend graduation, since the
date also happened to be the first day of my week-long Union Institute
orientation, held at the Vernon Manor Hotel in Cincinnati. My preference would
have been to get a PhD in Bioethics from Georgetown, which was the only
doctorate in Bioethics program available. But I did not want to leave town or
pay their huge fees, so, I did the next best thing and modeled my Union
program after Georgetown's. This would include several philosophy courses,
mainly to sharpen my thinking processes. A also planned segments in ethics
consultation and ethics committee work, ethics education, end of life ethics,
research ethics, narrative bioethics, and health law. Even at that time,
Bioethics was a relatively new field, and many people did not know exactly
what it was. Broadly defined, bioethics looks at the various moral aspects
involved in biology. Strictly speaking, my interest is in biomedical ethics,
which is interested in the moral features of health care, and is kind of a
jazzed up version of what was formerly called medical ethics, which involves
ethical issues in medical care, mainly by MDs. Bioethics is multidisciplinary,
and includes everyone involved in health care - physicians, nurses, social
service people, ministers, lawyers, and medically-oriented philosophers.
((Someplace, add my stuff on becoming an "ethics expert" and the Union
person's response to that idea.))

<p>My academic introduction to the PhD program was by way of the "Great Minds"
audio tape lecture series.

<p>August 10, 1992: Julie born - CS, etc. ((details re Laurie pregnancy See
under "Grandpawternalism" under Julie in original Q&amp;A))

<p>Dr. Chris McHenry, pediatrician/ethicist at Children's asked me to be a
facilitator for the first year medical student course in Health Care Ethics at
UC. This involved being a group leader for small group student sessions, in
which the students present cases and discuss various ethical subjects. Topics
included assisted death, confidentiality, research ethics, reproductive
ethics. I was also involved in the first year death and dying course, which
was given early in the first year of medical school.

<p>Other learning by lecturing: In October, a Northern Kentucky attorney asked
me to give a talk on advance directives to local lawyers. A group of 15 or 20
of them met at the Magic Wok, where I got a free lunch. I thought the session
went very well, but the attendees obviously had little knowledge in this area,
and asked very few questions. I did not make any vicious lawyer jokes, but the
group did not ask me back for a return engagement.

<p>((?What year was Nick W born - check my records.(?Put this stuff in that
year))

<p>By the fall of '92, Vic Magary was dying of colon cancer, and when he
started in the hospice program, the final handwriting was on the wall - he
likely had less than six months to live. There were still some old fences to
be mended. We had some breakfasts together, but really did not communicate
greatly. Our old conflicts were hard to overcome. When I asked if he was doing
any writing on his situation, he showed me some poems he did while being
treated for manic depression at Harding Psychiatric Hospital in Columbus. I
enrolled in the SEMC Hospice volunteer program, trying to broaden my
background in death and dying issues, and also hoping it would give me some
hints bringing finally bringing us together.

<p>In November, Vic was going rapidly downhill, and was confined to bed at
home. He called me one day with an interesting request - he wanted to know the
lethal dose of oral morphine. Naively, I assumed that he just wanted to make
sure he didn't take too many pills and accidentally overdose. Lacking a
pharmacology text, I bought a copy of Derek Humphrey's "Final Exit," a how-to
book on suicide, which gives lethal doses for commonly used sedatives and
opiates. Before I could get him this information, that same day, he was
admitted in what seemed a terminal condition, to the inpatient hospice unit at
SEMC. He was unresponsive at first, and nurses believed that he would soon
die. But, true to character, he once more fooled us, waking up and able to
have some minimal conversations. We also learned later that a nurse in the
hospital had found an empty morphine pill bottle in his robe. We never knew
for sure if he had taken an accidental or otherwise overdose, but the whole
scene was eerie. Vic died on December 8, five years to the day after the death
of our partner Larry Hiltz - more eeriness. I gave a eulogy for Vic at his
funeral, recalling some of the pleasant memories and sharing two of his poems
at the funeral mass, so our closure was probably as good as could be expected.

<p>On New Years' Eve, Kathy and I traveled to San Francisco, spent the evening
with the Wulfhorsts, and then headed to Maui for a medical meeting in health
law. Some of my fondest memories are from a previous trip to this Hawaiin
paradise. Several years before, we went there for a medical meeting, and had a
truly wonderful time. I can still visualize floating on a raft in the Pacific,
feeling the relaxing warm water, smell the salt water, without a care in the
world, and just being totally relaxed. I would later use that experience for
various meditation exercises, in which pleasureful, good events would be
visualized as examples of having a good heart and disposition which can be
shared with other people. But the 1993 Maui visit was not quite the same - the
island was much more commercialized, the natives more rude, the food not quite
as good. It was not nearly as much fun as the first trip. Truly unforgettable
times are never quite as good as the first time.

<p>In 1993 I was in high academic gear. Dr. Ed Pellegrino, a world famous
physician and ethicist at Georgetown had advised me to take lots of basic
philosophy courses. Despite my 18 hours of undergrad philosophy at XU in the
50's, I really did not "get" it. The dictionary defines philosophy as the
study, by argument and reason, of wisdom, truth, or knowledge. My rusty
argumentation and reasoning skills needed some sharpening. So early in the
year, I started at UC with "Metaethics," a very academic course, the focus
being on ethical theories, not on practical applications. There were three
required texts, and I wrote three essays. One of the essays was titled "Why
Bother With Ethical Theory." I tried to explain my position that ethical
theories should give some kind of practical guidance for making moral
decisions in everyday life. I used Piers Paul Reed's book Alive, the 1972
story of cannibalism after the Andes Mountain air crash, to show how the
development of an ethical theory might be useful in these situations. When
their food supplies ran out, and it become apparent that they would not be
rescued anytime soon, the survivors knew that a decision would soon need to be
made regarding the possible use of their dead companions for food. They used
the ethical theory of utilitarianism - means/ends - to justify cannibalism in
their situation. The means - cannibalism was justified to gain the means,
survival. The professor wondered whether I could justify anything with this
theory.

<p> <p>My next course at UC was "Metaphysics." The course "discusses the
nature of existence, reality and the external world, universals, relations and
properties, and causation. These are the kinds of things that college guys
might discuss when they are out drinking, when all of the late-night televised
games are finished. These courses were probably good mind exercises for me -
if nothing else, they might have taught be to think a little better. I also
took "Philosophy and Medicine," which was a basic ethical ethics course,
looking at the history of medicine and ethics." Later in the year, I took
"Philosophy of Mind." This looked at things like What does it really mean to
have a mind? and other ideas of consciousness. The required text was "Mind and
Cognition." I was dangerously close to thinking and writing from an analytic
or philosophic point of view.

<p>Pat and Sandy presented us with our first grandson on May 15, 1993. To mark
the occasion, I composed the following customized limerick:

<blockquote>
<p>For Peter Mueller, after his birth

<p>There was a small child named Pete,<br>
For a kid, he really was neat.<br>
A lot like his dad,<br>
This hungry young lad<br>
Really did love to eat.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>?Here, add some stuff about Laurie and Mark and grandpawternalism (see
under Q&amp;A, limerick) August 10, 1993: Julie is one year old. When she was
born, I was not doing limericks for the family. I tried to capture some of her
personality and funny stuff, as well as my own feelings about her.

<blockquote>
<p>Julie's First Birthday

<p>There once was a babe named Jule,<br>
For a kid, she really was cool.<br>
She seemed really smart,<br>
And had a good heart,<br>
If only she learned not to drool!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>In my capacity of med student teaching at SEMC, I finally became a
professor, albeit the non-reimbursed or voluntary type, being officially given
the title of "Volunteer Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology" at
the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. ((See end of 1994 for
details - pp 61, 62,63))

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">1994</h1>

<p>The year continued the intensity, with more academia. Early in the year, I
took an "Epistemology" course at UC. This looked at the theory of knowledge,
which looks at the nature of belief, truth, and justification. Knowledge is
defined as "a justified, true, belief in something." Of the three required
essays the significant one was "Searching for Truth in Moral Knowledge."
((?add some quotes))

<p>My last graduate level philosophy course at UC was "Kierkegaard and
Nietzsche," study of variations in philosophies of religion, and included
existentialism, the primacy of the will and being as opposed to rationalism,
and the problems of good and evil. My essays were "Kierkegaard's
Existentialist Ethics," and "Nietzsche's Perspectivism: A Method for Modern
Ethics." The professor did not appreciate my own interpretation
(perspectivism) of Nietzsche, and I got a B in the course, after getting A's
in the other five courses at UC. They were well worth the effort, but I was
happy not to be in the UC doctorate philosophy program.

<p>During the year, I began a 3 year stint on the Covington Diocese ProLife
Commission. This group was a more moderate reply to the local radical Right to
Life. ((Embellish))

<p>All work and no play, etc. is not good, so in January Aunt Pat Reinemeyer
joined us at a Luciano Pavarotti concert at Riverfront Colosseum in Cincy.

<p>After five years of grief, my malpractice suit wound down. There were
"Expert" witnesses claiming truth on both sides. On Jan 13 there was a mock
trial, but the case was settled on Feb 8, the night before the real trial
date. The settlement was for ?$700,000, but the memory of the case and the
severely retarded child would linger.

<p>((Has the following already been done?)) I am still amazed at the way my
program in ethics developed. Dr. Mark Siegler at U of Chicago suggested that I
have a cup of coffee with Terry Perlin, a PhD. ethicist at Miami U, Oxford.
Perlin reviewed my work on Extreme Prematurity, and on the way out of his
office, introduced me to Dr. Bob Mc--, a Cincinnati neurosurgeon/lawyer who
invited me to a Children's Hospital ethics conference. At this conference, I
was re-introduced to Chris McHenry, pediatrician/ethicist whom I had met
previously in Chicago. She asked me to teach in the UC Health Care Ethics
course for first year med students, which I had started in '92.

<p>((Starting CHE in Cincy))

<p>My required Union "internship" was spent at the Center for Clinical Ethics
at the University of Chicago. I spent the month of July, with a fairly
intensive academic review of medical ethics, and returned home for the next
two months. I then went back to Chicago for October, November and half of
December. The last was the best part, mainly for a health law course and
experience in ethics consultation. I was on call for consultation the last 2
months. I had some very complicated and challenging cases, the most satisfying
one being a woman who was brain dead, but whose family refused to allow
discontinuation of life. I spent several hours trying to explain the situation
to the family, along with a very inexperienced first year surgery resident.
The resident was concerned that she would get in trouble for keeping a dead
patient in a very busy <br/> ICU, which needed the bed for other critically
ill patients. I emphasized that a brain-dead patient really was dead, and the
only reason the heart was still beating was because the ventilator provided
oxygen to the heart. This was an artificial situation, and the heart would
stop when the ventilator was discontinued. At one point, I said that the
ventilator was not benefiting the patient. A daughter responded with "But what
about our benefit?" I did not have a good answer for that one. But after
several hours, the family finally agreed to removing the
ventilator/endotracheal tube, but only after the entire family could be
assembled, together with two of the family's clergymen. This came about at
noon on a Saturday morning. While we were waiting for the family to get
together, the first year resident asked me what happens if the heart does not
stop beating after the ventilator is removed? I told her - without much
confidence - not to worry, that the heart would stop within 10-15 minutes, and
the patient could then be officially pronounced dead. The heart did stop
within 5 minutes, she was pronounced dead, and everyone seemed to as satisfied
as possible under the circumstances. I was asked to give Grand Rounds for the
Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology service, which I did on November 11, my topic
being "Informed Consent Issues in Obstetrics." I finished my stay in Chicago
in mid December, and headed home very satisfied with the experience.

<p>Another great happening in Chicago was beginning a new friendship with
another ethics fellow, psychiatrist Mike Lipkin. He provided some very
valuable insight on depression, because of his experience as a physician, and
also having a history of severe depression himself. It happened that he had a
relapse while I was in Chicago, and I spent a lot of time talking to him the
last several weeks of my stay there. When I left in December, he was just
starting to pull out of it. It would turn out to be a very good and lasting
friendship.

<p>In June, I had my first ethics article published, in a somewhat obscure
journal, the Healthcare Ethics Committee Forum , "Institutional Ethics
Committees Do Not Have Any Special Responsibilities to the Non-Medical
Community." I was not really convinced of that, but the article challenged me
to place myself in an opposite position and give some convincing arguments.

<p>((Kathy working for McConnell)

<p>-Dr. Andy Baker at SEMC asked me to have sessions with the UC third year
med students on OB/Gyn clinical clerkships at SEMC. I would meet with 2 or 3
of them after the Perinatal Conferences, in which complicated Ob cases were
discussed. These included babies (fetuses) with lethal like anencephaly or
absent kidneys, or women with hypertension where delivery of previable babies
might be necessary. Cases like these are often rich with ethics, and I would
spend around one hour discussing these or some the students might wish to talk
about. The sessions turned out to be popular with the students, and word got
back to Dr. Clarence McClain at UC, who asked me to develop a prototype in Ob
ethics for the Ob/Gyn Department's interactive group learning program for 3 rd
year med students on Ob/Gyn service. ((See end of '94 for details)) ((See the
current case protocol for details)) The first case I selected was of a patient
who refused cesarean section for fetal distress. Students are asked to do an
ethical analysis of the case, focusing on the conflicting principles of
respect for patient choice (autonomy), versus the doctor's wanting to do what
is best for the patient(s) (duty to prevent harm). ((embellish))

<h1 class="page-break">1995</h1>

<p>In March, I did the final segment of my Union End-of Life Ethics course by
attending a Hospice conference in St.Louis: "For Your Patient in the End Stage
of Disease - What are the Options of Care?" This was one of my better
conferences, and included topics such as Modern Pain Management and Assisted
Dying. ((?Look up essays written))

<p>Pat and Sandy became parents for the second time, ushering Sam into the
world on June 17, 1995:

<blockquote>
<p>Sam Alexander Mueller

<p>Welcome Sam, to the human race,<br>
We finally get to see your handsome face.<br>
Will you be athletic and a real brain,<br>
And like brother pete, always raising cain?<br>
Hey - with your genes, you'll be an ace!<br>

<p>Love, Grandpa Mueller, june 17, 1995
</blockquote>

<p>July - Dec:

<p>Kathy's brother Dan reached #60 on July 24, 1995. He had a great Irish
tenor singing voice, and was in the carpet business with Sears for many years.
I recognized the milestone with the following:

<blockquote>
<p>Danny Reddy

<p>There once was a Reddy named Danny,<br>
Who was known to work off his fanny.<br>
A tenor extraordinaire,<br>
And a carpet man quite fair,<br>
His many talents were oh so uncanny!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>In the summer, I did some hospice volunteer work, having several visits
with Dr. John Cassidy. I had known him as a fellow physician, and enjoyed our
conversations. I believe he did also, but we never got into a discussion about
his dying. In talking to the hospice people about this, it was suggested that
I allow him to bring up the subject of death, but he never did.
Coincidentally, his mother was a Mueller, and he provided me with some
insights on German names. He had been a medical officer in WWII, serving with
General George Patton's outfit in the historic Battle of the Bulge in Europe.
War was always a popular topic. One day, he told me that he had never seen the
movie "*Mash*, the story about some wild and crazy doctors during the Korean
War ins the early 50's. Having 2 copies this film, I brought it the following
visit. The next week, I got the news that John had died. His wife was not sure
if he had seen the movie or not. "Mash" was a fairly racy film, so I hoped
that watching it did not hasten his death.

<p>In June, Julia Carter, a friend and director of the Wood Hudson Cancer Lab
in Newport recruited me for a lecture for her student researchers about ethics
in research. My lecture included some of my own lab experiences, as well as
the UC Radiation Experiments, dishonesty in research, and the relationships
between research and clinical practice. I used this as part of a segment for
my PhD program on research ethics. Earlier in the year, I had taken 2 courses
at UC on this, looking at topics like "Research Involving Human Subjects,"
"Scientific Misconduct," and "Institutional Review Boards."

<p>My Union program also required 10 "Peer Days," which consisted in one day
spent with other Union PhD candidates, where a specific subject was presented
or discussed. I was unaware of anyone else doing bioethics, but many people
were in clinical psychology. I attended 2 peer days with these people, and
gave a spiel Health Care Ethics and "Ethics in Clinical Psychology" for each
of these. One of the most interesting peer days was one at the Cincinnati Art
Museum, "Behind the Scenes," in which we were introduced to the various
techniques of restoration of older paintings. The final 3 peer days were spent
in Columbus Ohio, for sessions on the "Survivors of Sexual Abuse." "This was a
very thought-provoking conference.

<p>I was appointed to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG) Committee on Ethics, which met twice yearly in Washington, DC. We
reviewed various ethical issues, and worked on specific policies, such as
Informed Consent and Maternal-Fetal Conflicts. ((?Other subjects))

<p>The highlight of the year was Tom and Patty's wedding in November. A great
time was had by all, and we got to see good friends Ernie and Florence
Mazzaferri (Tom's godparents), and Fr. Bob Holden, who gave his usual great
homily, along with a beautiful wedding mass.

<p>In August, I completed a two year Union individualized History of Ethics
course with Fr. Gerry Twadell of Thomas More College. The course looked at
various philosophers and ethical theories from Plato through the Utilitarians
like John Mill and Peter Singer. I did several essays, including "Plato's
Republic: What's in It for a Bioethicist," "Aristotle, Ethics, and Practical
Wisdom," "St.Augustine, Lust, and Morality," and "Modern Applications of
Kant's Categorical Imperatative." ((?Give a few quotes))

<p>I returned To UChicago in November for the annual MacLean Ethics Conference
and did a presentation: "Interactive Group Learning Sessions for Ob/Gyn
Student Ethics Education." Also visit with Mike and Nina.

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">1996</h1>

<p>In February, Fr. Bob Holden called for a second opinion for a medical
problem. He was having some disturbing cardiac symptoms which his own primary
doc was not too excited about. They were very suspicious to me, and my advice
was for him to make an immediate call to the doctor and ask at what point he
would be referred to a cardiologist. Bob called back the same next day, saying
that he had seen a cardiologist in Toledo, and was scheduled for a coronary
angiogram the next day. This showed severe coronary artery disease, and he had
bypass surgery the following day.

<p>

<p>While I was scrambling to finish the paper work, red tape, and other crap
for my doctorate, Peter was hospitalized for severe pneumonia in April. We
were very worried, and on the day of my final doctoral committee meeting,
Kathy flew to Raleigh to lend a helping hand and to talk with his attending
MDs. After some anxious moments, he finally recovered, and I marked the
situation for his third birthday with the following:

<blockquote>
<p>Peter at Three

<p>It was a bummer, being sick, oh my!<br>
All day in bed you needed to lie.<br>
Pneumonia sure isn't fun,<br>
But you stuck it out like a big-un.<br>
We're sure proud of our gutsy little guy!<br>

<p>Love, Papa Mueller, may 15, 1996
</blockquote>

<p>grandpawternalism on may 31,1996, i received my ph.d. from the union
institute. one requirement for the degree was a segment called "personal
development" achieved during the doctorate program. this bit was to reflect my
overall development as a person, as well as the acquisition of new skills. the
arrival of three grandkids during the doctorate process gave me the
opportunity, in fact the necessity, of learning a new skill - grandfathering.
since all four of my own kids were born during the busiest time of my career,
i was not able to spend a great deal of time with them. "active"
grandfathering could allow me to compensate for this deficiency, in at least a
small way. i have somewhat negative memories of my own grandparents - lots of
crankiness and dark houses. this might explain my tendency to turn on all the
lights in my own house during my own kid's and grandkids visits. for my own
specific approach to quality time, i coined the term "grandpawternalism":
being paternalistic toward one's grandchildren; the attempt to look our for
their own best interests, as defined by their grandfather; the tendency to
overprotect these children, by action or advice; acting to protect their
mental or physical well-being when it appears threatened. i generally would
intervene only when significant or permanent problems might arise without my
interference. for example, i would physically remove them from harm's way
whenever necessary, without regard to their own wishes at the time. during her
first two years, julie suffered from recurrent ear infections.i arranged
consultations with an ear specialist who proceeded to employ timely surgical
treatments. i believed that without a certain amount of interference -
grandpawternalism - she would have risked deafness, mastoiditis, meningitis,
an possible allergies resulting from prolonged antibiotic use. grandfathering
for peter and sam has been more challenging because of the distance, so we try
to visit them whenever we can. the personalized limericks have been a kind of
poetic journal, in which i try to capture their essence and individual
progress though the years. i classify myself as a golden rule ethicist - i try
to use the same consideration for others (patients) as you would want for
yourself or your family. so, i have used some of this with julie. when i see
or hear that she has treated someone badly, my response has sometimes been
"you wouldn't want me to hit you like that, would you?" i don't believe there
has been too much strict grandpawternalism. ideally, my ethical stance would
not permit it. but these activities have provided me with the wonderful
opportunity to watch the grandkids develop into bright, active, and highly
fun-provoking little human beings. i have greatly enjoyed theirs and my own
personal growth!

<p>My doctorate advisor, John Talmadge, a Yale PhD, did not appreciate this
segment of my program. He did tell me that I had taken many more courses than
usual, for any program. With that out of the way, I could now concentrate on
getting my dissertation, "The Informed Consent Process in Obstetrics"
published. Stephen Post had told me that the diss. was one of the best he had
seen from anyone, and that it was very publishable. My doctorate committee,
especially Stephen and Mary Mahowald hade suggested that I first get some
chapters published in peer-reviewed journals, to enhance the chances for the
book being published. That part never got off the ground. I worked on some of
the best chapters - "Advance Directives for Pregnant Women," and --, but I
was never satisfied to a point that I liked. I gave out 4 copies of the dis.,
3 to OB/Gyn friends. Only 2 people were interested enough in the topic to read
it. And friend Ernie Mazzaferri asked me why I wanted to have the book
published in the first place. I thought there was a lot of good info in it for
the average MD in practice, but I doubted whether many of them would take the
time to read it, like my friends. So the only real reason for publishing was
ego, and I had other projects to work on, (like "Smelling like a Rose.") So I
saved much time, energy, sweat, and eye strain by saying the hell with it, and
putting it on the shelf for my reference only.

<p>In the fall, I taught a semester-long course in bioethics at Thomas More
College, as Adjunct Professor of Philosophy. It was enjoyable, but exhausting.
I was asked to do the course again for the next semester, but declined, as it
would be three hours in the evening, which I knew would be brutal. But I was
not asked back the following year. No reason was ever given for my
"termination." My stipend was $1500 per semester, which was the exact amount
of the fee for a vaginal hysterectomy with A-P repair I had received during my
last year in practice. Since my disability payments precluded making a salary,
I donated the $1500 to Thomas More. By not receiving a salary, there appeared
to be some concern about the college's liability if I were injured on campus.
My evaluations by the students were mostly positive, but I had been fairly
critical in grading their final essays. Perhaps the powers that be decided I
was good, but not that good, and was not worth the liability. ((?Look up
student evaluations comments))

<p>In January, I was appointed chair of the Ethics Committee at SEMC. I had
sort of lobbied for it, with the idea that I had something special to offer.
(give some of the topics for discussion, agenda items, etc.

<p>Also in January, I had the feeling that the MS was progressing. It was hard
to quantify, but my legs were definitely weaker, was having more trouble
walking distances and up stairs. Talked to Dr. Farrell, and started on a new
product, Avonex, self-injecting the meds twice weekly. After 2 months, it was
apparent that I was actually feeling worse, mainly weakness and increased
fatigue. We discussed possible Rx with another new drug, Copaxone. An
"annoying" side effect with this is tight mid-chest pain. Kathy wondered how
this could be differentiated from a heart attack, and the answer was "it's not
easy to tell the difference." The muscle weakness in my legs was also causing
back pain. Just dragging the legs around and twisting my back to compensate
for MS-caused balance problems really hurt the back. I had several physical
therapy sessions, and started a stretch-exercise program designed to build up
the back muscles.

<h1 class="page-break">1998</h1>

<p>On February 12, the date of Abe Lincoln's and Charles Darwin's birthday,
Tom and Patty had their second beautiful little girl, Hannah. My first present
for her:

<blockquote>
<p>Hannah Virginia Mueller

<p>What is your future, little Hannah?<br>
You seem to have a very sweet manner.<br>
Will you have a scientific mind,<br>
Or like dad, be musically inclined?<br>
And play the piana and sing "Oh Susannah!"<br>
</blockquote>

<p>((?Add original stuff from 1995)) This was my last year of ACOG Ethics
Committee Publication of my contribution as primary contributor, of Committee
on Ethics Opinion: "Ethical Considerations in Research Involving Pregnant
Women, Technical Bulletin #213, November, 1998. ((?one sentence description))

<p>Mike Lipkin called from Chicago in May, apologizing for not returning my
calls. He had a good reason. While visiting is son in California, he passed
out, was hospitalized, diagnose with a major heart block, and received
electric corrections (shocks) to normalize the cardiac rhythm. Mike has a
history of severe depression, and needed several months of various medication
trials in 1994 to get him back to some semblance of psychiatric normality. He
came very close to getting electric shock treatment. So in our conversation, I
had to ask him if the cardiac shocks had any effect on his mood. He thought it
may have improved slightly. Not letting him off the hook this easily, I
dispatched a "get well limerick" on May 13, 1998: <h1 class="page-break"><a
name="_MIKE_GETS_SHOCKED"><span/></a>MIKE GETS SHOCKED</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>There once was a cool shrink named Mike,<br>
A guy you really could like.<br>
But he was a tad mentally locked,<br>
That is, until he got shocked.<br>
Then this strike gave his psyche a big hike!!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Not be outdone, Mike struck back on June 1 with:

<blockquote>
<p>There once was a man named Maurice.<br>
He seldom disturbed someone's peace.<br>
Then he let down his hair;<br>
Became Bud - with a flair -<br>
His limericks now never cease!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>I was greatly pleased. Mike's mood was now obviously upbeat, and I now my
own personalized limerick.

<p>((?Where is Garv's for me))

<p>The MS seemed to be progressing, slowly but surely, and the back pain was
continuing despite the physical therapy, etc. Somewhat discouraged, I dropped
out of the stretches, swimming etc. Dr. Farrell mildly chastised/counseled me
about this, with words, like "going into a downward spiral, ending up an
invalid," etc. I did not argue with him, but it is not easy doing all of the
stretching and swimming when you are having pain, and when these activities
cause you more pain. I talked to him about getting into a clinical trial of
some kind at some MS center, and he gave me a list of several possibilities. I
decided to visit the Cleveland Clinic to see what they might have available.
In October 1998 saw Dr. Richard Ruddick at the Clinic, who started me on
methotrexate (MTX). This is a very potent drug, used mostly for malignancies.
Because of effects on the liver, lungs, and bone marrow, alcohol intake is not
permitted. When I asked Ruddick about this, he gave me "permission" to have a
glass of wine or two on Saturdays, if I took the MTX on Wednesdays. Since I
was not too steady on my feet when sober, this was a good excuse to just go
off the sauce completely. So after a 50 year HABIT, I became a teetotaler!

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">1999 ((My B-17 flight, 99 or 2000?))</h1>

<p>This was my first year with the newly formed Goodwyn Institutional Review
Board, which reviews ethical aspects of research protocols. I enjoyed the
work, and also getting a paycheck again.

<p>((Have some of this info in ?93))I continued my yearly presentations on
Ethics in Research started in 1993, for the student researchers at Wood Hudson
Cancer Laboratory in Newport. These are mostly pre-med college students. My
lectures usually included personal lab experiences (?St Francis lab
hematocrits). Also, current lay press stories of research ethics such as
cloning research by a Lexington KY researcher. At each session, I also gave 3
capsule cases involving students and various ethics scenarios with their lab
work. In one of these, Carl C. didn't attend his recent organic chemistry lab.
It is now 2:00 AM, and the lab report is due in 6 hours. He is desperate,
because a poor grade in the course would jeopardize his chances for acceptance
into med. School. So he pulls out a report his roommate wrote last year for
this unit of the course. The roommate had left all of his notes and reports
with Carl to help him get through the course. Carl copies his roommate's old
data and report, changing an occasional phrase, and submits it. Are Carl's
actions ethical? Why or why not? Depending upon the student's responses, I ask
open-ended questions, such as " Would you choose someone like Carl for your
own primary care doctor, assuming he makes it through med. school? My aims for
the sessions are to get them thinking about ethics, and also to point out the
practical reasons for ethical research. Ie, Importance of subject/patient
trust in in their doctor/researcher.

<p>Grandson Sam was 4 on June 17, 1999. He received the following statement of
love always from Paw Paw:

<blockquote>
<p>Sam's 4th birthday

<p>A dashing young fellow named Sam,<br>
Wasn't exactly a sweet little lamb.<br>
Although musically inclined,<br>
He had a sports-directed mind.<br>
And could be tough as a ram!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Our grandkids were generally evened out when proud parents Tom and Patty
welcomed son Noah into the world on August 20, 1999. He was handed the
following:

<blockquote>
<p>Noah Thomas Mueller

<p>"Noah" means comfort, or rest.<br>
But at birth, he screamed with unrest!<br>
Built much like a tank,<br>
Almost too big to spank.<br>
Without doubt, this kid shows great zest!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Toward the end of the year, I told Laurie that I wanted to start paying
more attention to my spiritual life. The MS was progressing not rapidly, but I
figured I could use some extra help.So, for Christmas, 1999, she gave me Joan
Borysenko/s book, A Pocketful of Miracles." It's a little paperback with daily
readings focusing on spirituality and meditation, taken from a wide variety of
cultures and religions. The author is Jewish, but includes a wide variety of
thoughts and practices from other religions and cultures. The book piqued my
interest in Buddhism, with its emphasis on compassion, meditation and
mindfulness. My MS-induced physical and mental uncoordination seems to benefit
by focusing on mindfulness, which is a moment-to-moment, non-judgmental
awareness. This heightened state of being awake also involves being more
attuned to all the wonders of nature and creation. I try to start the day with
the Buddhist practice of Metta or lovingkindness meditation: "May I be at
peace, May my heart remain open, May I awaken to the light of my own true
nature, May I be healed, May I be a source of healing for all beings." After
this personal beginning, Metta can then be applied to family, friends, people
I'm not getting along with, and finally, on to all persons: "May all of us be
at peace."

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">2000</h1>

<p>My submitted paper on "Ethics Education For Medical Students: Interactive
Group Learning Sessions in Obstetrics" was refused publication by
Obstet'Gynec, the second rejection for the paper. It had previously been
rejected by the Journal of Clinical Ethics, and I will probably not waste
further time re-writing and resubmitting to a third journal. The aim of these
interactive sessions is to provide a stimulus for independent and reflective
learning, for both medical and ethical material. The students are expected to
recognize the ethical features of cases, to develop a familiarity with the
ethical concepts which accompany these cases, and to develop a practical
method for ethical case analysis. I was encouraged to resubmit this paper, but
I asked myself: Why do I want to get this published? I thought it was fairly
new material, but reviewers thought otherwise.

<p>Some other people thought I did have something to share. Jesuit Fr. Bob
Baumiller at XU, geneticist and ethicist, invited me to lecture his bioethics
class on physician-assisted suicide. I had met Bob at a meeting of BENO, the
Ohio Bioethics group. He is an older guy, heavy, was sitting alone at lunch,
so I joined him. His first comment was "What's with the cane?" I was starting
to be more open with it, and said I had MS. We proceeded in a more humorous
vein, when he told me he was a Jesuit at XU, and I said "I won't hold that
against you." It would be the beginning of a good relationship.

<p>For her fourth birthday on November 24, I sent Gretchen the following
present:

<blockquote>
<p>Gretchen is four years old

<p>This very young "little old lady" is now four.<br>
In just one year, she can do so much more.<br>
Very articulate, and quite agile,<br>
The kid's a tough chick, not at all fragile.<br>
The things she says really make us roar!<br>
</blockquote>

<h1>2001</h1>

<p>I gave Tom's little Hannah the following present when she turned three on
February 12, with love forever from Paw Paw:

<blockquote>
<p>Hannah is three years old

<p>There once was a kid named Hannah,<br>
She was cute, and slender as a banana.<br>
A real-live toy,<br>
But a little bit coy -<br>
Look out for her foxy dead-panner!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Early in the year 2001, there was an increase in neck and back pain, and I
saw Dr. Rissover, a physiatrist (physical medicine specialist. Various
medication combinations did not help. And the MS seemed to be getting worse:
legs weaker, almost tripped several times; generalized weakness and more
easily fatigued; voice fatigue after talking only a few minutes; weakness
right hand; concentration problems. Dr. Farrrell concurred that this
represented a relapse, and in March, I was Rx'd with IV SoluMedrol at home,
with fair results. The treatment and its benefits were greatly facilitated by
Kathy, who made it go more smoothly:

<blockquote>
<p>Kathy, R.N.

<p>There once was a girl named Kathy,<br>
Had a spouse who was somewhat daffy.<br>
Twas a very fine nurse,<br>
Who hated to hear Bud curse.<br>
Presto - her great care made him more laffy!!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>I gave Laurie a copy of a poem from my poetry book, by Christopher Smart,
called "My Cat Jeoffry." Julie saw it and was apparently inspired. In April,
she submitted a poem for her third grade class at St.Henry:

<blockquote>
<p>Cats, by Julia Kemen

<p>Cats are sometimes fat,<br>
They sometimes eat rats.<br>
They'll sleep in your chair,<br>
They'll sleep in your hair.<br>
What crazy mammals they are!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>There were more ominous happenings in the area in April. An unarmed black
man in Cincy was killed by a police officer, setting off three days of race
riots. It drew national attention, and started ongoing efforts to improve race
relations, which had been seething for many years. There was a lot of hate on
both sides, and obviously required increased focus on communication.

<p>During the summer, the hot ethics topic was embryonic stem cell research.
This technology has the potential for many chronic devastating conditions,
particularly Parkinsons, Diabetes, Alzheimers, MS. Currently, private
researchers are using tissue derived from frozen embryos from left-over
in-vitro fertilization clinics. It might help to clarify the issue by looking
from two separate perspectives: 1). The current state of frozen embryos; 2).
The status of stem cell research. If not used by the couple their embryos will
be either donated to another couple, used for research, or discarded.
Advocates argue that since some of the embryos will be discarded anyway, why
not use them for research purposes. This is a utilitarian argument: if the
good of the others will result in the action, then it should be done. The
analogy of organ donation is also used: if a family can donate the organs of
their deceased relative, then couples could donate their embryonic cells for
research, which will die when "discarded." The current recommendation is that
the frozen embryos should not be used for fertilization attempts after being
frozen for five years, and if not used, should be discarded at that time. The
"political" issue now is whether or not federal funds should be used for
embryonic stem cell research. Federal funding would necessitate various
guidelines and requirements for the private research already being done, and
thus would provide more control. I feel this would be appropriate, using the
utilitarian argument, and also a kind of golden rule (GR) perspective. This
may be stretching the GR somewhat, but if I were a frozen embryo, and could
somehow know" that my existence would be ending soon (discarded), then I would
"gladly" accept the ending my "life" for the purpose of research which will
potentially be live-saving to many future persons.

<p>July 6, 2001: first novantrone.

<p>I celebrated Noah's birthday on August 20, with lots of love and the
following:

<blockquote>
<p>Noah is two

<p>Time is flying - Noah is two years old.<br>
The boy is energetic, handsome, and bold.<br>
He loves trains,<br>
And seems blessed with brains.<br>
When god made his kid, he broke the mold!<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Kathy took a well-deserved trip to Italy in August. She received the
following welcome-home gift:

<blockquote>
<p>Kathy's Italy trip

<p>Welcome home Kathy, from Italy!<br>
By myself I've done rather gritally.<br>
Batching hasn't been bad,<br>
But being alone can be sad.<br>
Without you, dear, I tend to do shitally!<br>

<p>August 16, 2001

<p>All my love, Bud

<p>OUR 40TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY - SEPTEMBER 9, 2001 (ON AUGUST 24, 2001)
    
<p>Bob Holden and I came up with a format for a special anniversary mass, and
we played some appropriate music of Tony Bennet ("I Found You Just in Time,"
and Frank Sinatra ("September Song," and also Charlotte Church's songs from the
old Latin mass. All the kids and grandkids came home, and I started the
festivities with:

<blockquote>
<p>Kathy and I are very pleased that all of you could make it today. We
wanted to do something memorable. Our family has not been what you would call
religious. For various reasons, we did not go to church on a regular basis.
But lately I have become more focused on spirituality. I started thinking that
with my medical situation, I need all the help I can get. Maybe with more
attention to spiritual aspects, possibly I would feel better. So the
anniversary mass seems to fit right in to our life. It's extra special, since
Fr. Bob Holden is my best friend. Our friendship goes back almost 60 years, so
that makes it even more fantastic. 
</blockquote>

<p>The ceremony and party was truly once in a
lifetime, and everyone seemed to have a good time.

<p>Two days later, 9/11/2001, left us with different kinds of memories. The
suicide bombers hit the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City
and the Pentagon in DC, with 4,000 innocent people killed by radical Islamic
terrorists. I E-mailed the 4 kids the following: 

<blockquote>
<p>We are still getting over
the shock of today's bombings - we are in another world war! Laurie called
this afternoon and told us what the teacher said to Julie's class at school.
Julie's take-home message was that she did not need to worry about getting
hurt. I think this is a good attitude for kids, otherwise they might be
worried sick about getting killed. But sometime in the future they will need
to come to grips with what happened today, but not quite yet. I am not sure
what we should tell them, except at some point to realize that there are a lot
of really insane people out there, who believe that the killing they are doing
is a holy project, a holy war. It could be the "Holy Land" or Northern
Ireland. The people who were killed today didn't do anything to deserve dying,
but I don't know how to explain this to an 8 or 9 year old kid. Bad things can
happen to good people, and it is not their fault. I do know that we need to
express our love for each other better. And this should begin at home. Lots of
love to all of you!! 

<p>Dad and Mom.
</blockquote>

<p>On Sept. 21, I sent a follow-up Email to the gang: 
    
<blockquote>
<p>Things will never be
quite the same in our lives, so we need to make some adjustments in attitudes
and actions. I had an interesting situation this AM which shows the need to
stay cool and look out for other guys. This AM, I discovered that I had 20
minutes to prepare for an IRB teleconference. I was more than a little ticked
off - I was not quite awake, hungry, and had not looked at the material. Then
I found out that the conference leader had driven all night from DC - Reagan
National Airport was still closed, and our Email had not been sent - viruses,
worms, other crises, etc. This info gave it a new perspective. There will be
lots of unexpected occurrences in our future, so we need to be ready for just
about anything, and especially need to be more considerate of each other than
ever.
</blockquote>

<p>"Our current war status reminds me of the fear surrounding the Cuban
missile crisis in the fall of 1962, during my internship. I was scheduled to
go on active duty with the Navy the following year,and I needed to give a
preference for duty stations. I wasn't sure where the "safest" location would
be - east or west coast. Where would our little family of 3.5 be the
farthest distance from a nuclear attack from Cuba? Did the distance make
that much difference in a nuclear war? I vacillated so much that I don't
remember my final choice, but the Navy provided a happy medium - Kingsville,
TX. Fortunately, the problem was resolved. In our current crisis, thee is also
the potential for some kind of nuclear event, or some other weapon of mass
destruction. It's hard for me not to be obsessed about this, but we have to go
about our usual business, and do the best job we can with our lives.
Hopefully, the kids get the message of tolerance, and not get too traumatized.
All of us need to avoid getting into a mode of retaliation, vengeance, and
other hates which have been going on in the Middle East for centuries.
Terrorists like bin Laden are still seeking revenge for the Crusades of the
middle ages. People have to try to work things out calmly and cooly before
getting into this mutual hate which has perpetuated the madness.

<p>On Sept 22, Laurie Emailed us that Julie had a nightmare that she was in a
bus that crashed into a building.

<h1 class="page-break">2002</h1>

<p>April, 2002 was Sue and Len Warnecke's Golden Anniversary, they were
greeted with the following:

<blockquote>
<p>Sue and Len's 50th 

<p>This is for Sue and Len,<br>
Who can now be said to be golden.<br>
Much has happened in 50 years,<br>
Some tears, but lots of cheers,<br>
And you've raised 5 wonderful men!<br>

<p>Love always,

<p>Bud and Kathy, April 15, 2002
</blockquote>

<p>The Warnecke "boys" really are pretty good guys, and looks like they are
also pretty good fathers themselves. (?Len as role model)

<p>St. Francis of Assisi has always been a hero of mine. ((See list of
attributes)):

<p>Sense of humor, love of nature, meditation. His approach to God was very
simple&lt; with an emphasis on creation and the beauty of nature. Nature is
God's footprints, and we can pray and praise God by getting more in touch with
nature. After reading Francis' biography and watching tapes, became interested
in the Secular Franciscan Order (SFO), also known as the Third Order of St.
Francis. These are groups of men and women who meet regularly, trying to
emulate the attitudes of Francis. I went to my first meeting April, 2002.
16-17 people, described as kind of a spiritual support group. My current
men'prayer group has been meeting for the past 2 years, and I generally enjoy
the sessions. But I might get more out of the SFO - trying to emulate Francis
and basically simplify my life.

<p>During May, I was pondering my own mortality. Within two weeks time, three
close friends were diagnosed with cancer - Bev Reddy, Joyce Tappan, and Gerry
Benzinger. So far, all appeared to have treatable diseases. Other buddies have
major health problems - Garv McClain with kidney disease, and will get a
transplant early next year, and Mike Lipkin with hepatitis C, potentially
needing a liver transplant in the near future. With this in mind, I did the
following for Joyce Tappan:

<blockquote>
<p>We searched long and hard<br>
For our good friend Joyce's card.<br>
Found one really nifty,<br>
But it cost three dollars fifty,<br>
So here's one from the superior avenue bard.<br>

<p>Love, Bud and Kathy, June, 2002
</blockquote>

<p>My current favorites for relaxation: Puccini, (La Boheme, Madam Butterfly,
Billy Joel, ("Keepin the Faith," Gloria Estafen ("The Words Get In the Way,"
Mattise, Renoir John Updike, Phillip Roth, John Grisham, Iris Murdock.

<p>Watching Grandkids

<p>Travel of any kind is becoming a real grind, even short trips. The car ride
makes my neck and back pain worse. I will soon need to decide whether to drop
the Ob Ethics sessions at UC. They have been fun in the past, but if the ride
over and back plus the sitting for the 2 hour sessions cease become more like
torture, I will stop. This is probably irrational, but I have this feeling
that I only have so much energy and capacity for enjoyment left, so some of
the extracurricular, non-paying activities will have to go. The first year
Health Care Ethics Course at UC will continue as long as possible, since these
have always been enjoyable. All of the teaching also provides a distraction of
sorts - listening to the students takes my mind off my discomfort.

<p>Another budding poet in the family:

<blockquote>
<p>The First Thankgiving

<p>There were some pilgrims who sailed on a ship.<br>
They sailed to America and it was a very long trip.<br>
They ran out of food and got very sick.<br>
Some of them died,<br>
but finally they met some Indians and one was named Rick.<br>
He taught them to catch their own food like fish and turkey.<br>
He also taught them to plant vegetables like corn and pumpkins and celery.<br>
He was so nice, they planned a party.<br>
So when you eat Thanksgiving meal, remember this story.<br>
Think about the Indians and Pilgrims.<br>

<p>New Year's Day, 2004 - my 68 th birthday, it was limerick payback time,
from grandchildren Gretchen (6), Hannah(5), and Noah (4):

<blockquote>
<p>Papa - We think you're so sweet<br>
When we're near, we feel your heat.<br>
You're a new year's baby,<br>
We kids think maybe,<br>
PaPa is really neat!<br>

<p>Love,

<p>January 1, 2004

<p>So life has been very good. There have been some setbacks. But I have a
wonderful wife, 4 great kids, and 6 beautiful grandchildren. If that ain't
luck, I don't know what is!

<p>March 2004. Still seeing "patients" -- Greg Claypole, Bennie McDowall, Asian
guy at 5 seasons. ((?Put this in with other patients -- they are not in other
autobio, in "Bud's Docs" Could not find it anyplace March 27, 2004)) "Case
Consultation": 90 Year Old Wants to Die. First heard of case in January.
Patient's spouse died recently, does not want to go on living. Pt announced
intention to discontinue food and fluids. I offered to see patient then, in
capacity of ethics consultant, but I did not see until latter March, when
patient requested it. Pt. is bed-ridden, almost blind, but alert and fairly
good memory. Stayed for one hour. Did not discuss death or dying. Might return
for future visit(s) if pt. consents. (More or less as a hospice volunteer).

<p>August 21, 2004. 50 th Reunion, St. John's High School, Delphos, Ohio. One
more patient. When will this stop? The reunion was fairly calm until
mid-mealtime at Knights of Columbus Hall. Sitting next to me, Marilyn Diller's
husband Mike Larkin suddenly keeled over on the floor. Thinking it was a heart
attack or stroke, I got down with him to check his airway. He opened his eyes
and it became obvious that he was choking. I asked if he could sit up, and
somehow, I got him up far enough to do a Heimlich. After the second thrust, a
huge chunk of steak came flying out of his mouth and he was ok. Other than
badly bent glasses and a big head bump where he hit the floor, everything
seemed fine. It happened so quickly, few people in the room even knew what had
happened, and I finally got tired of explaining it. (Provigil, spiritual,
?coincidence, Friday night asking Warnecke's about emergency calls, re Bishop)

<p>(Now see boryshenko's interconnectedness, possible brief summary or my
life, esp. ethics after MS Dx)

<p>SALLY R.I.P.

<p>On April 29, 2005, our faithful dog Sally passed away, at age 16. She was a
good companion, a caring but funny dog, and will be missed. I remember when
guests were leaving the house and we would stand and talk in the hall, saying
our goodbyes. Sally would often join us there and take part in the
socializing, watching intently.

<p>PRETENDING TO BE EXUBERANT

<p>January 15, 2006: Caravaggio and Exuberance. Last year before Dan and
Melissa's wedding, Patty was drawing up some family items for a party. One of
the questions on the personal list was "How would you describe yourself." My
facetious answer was : "Tall, Dark, and handsome." Well, 1 out of 3 ain't bad.
Obviously, my answer should have been "Interesting (?weird) sense of humor."

<p>JANUARY 2006 "PRETENDING TO BE EXUBERANT"

<p>After taking almost a year to read it, I finally finished Kay Jamison's
"Exuberance: The Passion for Life." Jamison is a psychologist and world expert
on bipolar disorders (manic depression). She also authored "An Unquiet Mind: A
Memoir of Moods and Madness," which chronicles her own experience as a
bipolar patient. She has written about famous bipolar persons, but often
focusing on their depression. "In Exuberance", the emphasis is on the manic,
hypomanic, and near-manic personalities of people like Theodore Roosevelt,
John Muir, etc. (add more names from book. The book evoked lots of
introspection about my own personality, and whether I had any elements of
exuberance. I have never thought of myself as such, but at some point last
year 2005), I decided to "pretend to be exuberant." If I wasn't naturally
energetic, maybe if I tried to be that way, some of it would rub off. It might
even turn out to be a teaching tool - Jamison talks about the way exuberant
people tend to invigorate others. It might be my acting lessons finally
kicking in, but I have tried to be more enthusiastic doing my ethics lectures
at UC, XU, and at the Wood Hudson Lectures for student researchers. The idea
is to get the students more active, involved, and interested in whatever
subject we're discussing. So far, it appears to be working.

<p>My SEMC Ethics Committee also seems to be responsive to the "technique".
Maybe I have just tended to select exuberant people to be Committee members,
but I like to believe my energy might be contagious. Or could it be that my
acting classes are finally bearing fruit?

<p>JANUARY 2006 Enter Caravaggio. ((Give brief description of the artist and
his work. One of his most attractive traits is ( what I like most about him is
the EXUBERANCE, earthiness, irreverence)

<p>August 2006 - mini-reunion with Mike and Bob in SF-San Jose.

<p>NEED LIMERICK: August 15, 2006: Dan and Melissa proud parents: Enter Beck
Robert Mueller, at 6lb 9oz, 20 in, Seattle, WA 

<p>November 28, 2006: Possible my 2nd last appearance at UC for teaching. I'd
given up on 1st and 3rd year ethics courses - students not too interested,
poor class prep and performance. But the new 2nd year course looked
intriguing, and included subjects that interested me, like embryonic stem
cell research, patient competency, and vegetative state, all in an interactive
format. But the class on this date was too much like the others, and with the
preparation plus trip to UC campus not worth the trouble. Unless the final
class next week is much better, I will definitely fade into the UC sunset.
When it's no longer fun, why bother?

<p>The next class on December 5 was Persistent Vegetative State, and I ended
up doing most of the talking. In addition, the parking garage elevator was
out, so I had to drive the scooter around 3 floors of the garage. Fortunately,
there was no other traffic. But I figured this was a sign or the last straw,
or something. So it was to be my UC teaching swan song. It was nice while it
was fun, but who needs this crap at age 71?

<p>Interest in Religion, God - -Lent 2007. In the past, I had occasionally tried
to do some special Lenten reading. This year's focus was on Jesus. I don't
have any qualms about the existence of God. In my own simplistic way, current
images of various areas in the galaxy and universe leads me to the idea that
some kind of a Great Presence has had something to do with all of this
splendor. But how does Jesus Christ fit into the picture: The concept of the
Trinity seems to be on thin ice, and my beliefs regarding the divinity of J.C.
are especially vague. But a "Jesus theory" might speculate the following: that
God was not satisfied with the way humans behaved throughout our history. God,
being God, really cannot be expected to comprehend or appreciate humans. Dr.
Jack Miles is an ex-Jesuit with expertise in middle eastern history. In his
book "Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God" presents a theory that God made a
mistake by punishing Adam's disobedience and continuing punishing mankind with
horrendous bloodshed. Not being human, He did not appreciate human nature, and
overreacted with various massacres throughout history, especially regarding
the Jews and their enemies. So one solution might be to send an entity (Jesus)
who would have all of the attributes of human nature, and so might be able to
bridge the knowledge gap between us and God. God would thus be educated, and
humankind would receive instructions from Jesus on how to be Godlike. Although
some disregarded Jesus' message, and killed him, his resurrection led to
billions of followers.

<p>2007: "Quantum Theology: Spiritual Implications of the New Physics" by the
Irish Catholic theologian Diamuid O'Murchu has some insights on why
Christianity has flourished. It's not an easy read, especially the quantum
mechanics part. But an emphasis on the synchronicity and the
interconnectedness of all things, past, present, and future is significant.
And in a short segment on "Resurrection from the Dead," the author notes the
following regarding Christ's own resurrection from the dead: 1). We have "the
life-witness of a group of disenchanted followers, so transformed by the
experience (whatever that was) that they gave their very lives for their
Christian convictions; 2). A Christian culture of 2000 years numbering today
1.5 billion people spread throughout the earth; 3). It is hard to imagine that
the totality of Christian culture, as we have known it to date, is based on a
grand delusion." (pp. 176-177)

<p>((?ME: why not a quantum ethics? What might that entail? - Google it ?))

<p>In August 2008, I read The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch. The author was
diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer, and writes the book for his wife
and small children. I can relate to Pausch in several ways. I also have a
chronic incurable, disease, although not one that will likely cause my death,
at least in the near future. I have told some friends that "people are more
important than things" - eg, family should come first, such as at those times
when I am trying to make a buck. Haven't always done that, and I should
probably look into this aspect of my life.

<p>Like the author, I am probably also a "recovering jerk". No one ever set me
down and lectured me on being a jerk. But, fortunately, there have been times
when people did put me in my place like when I was feeling sorry for myself
for being poor and having to work my way through life. (Fr. Herr, during
college years of 54-58). And earlier, when I was just being a smart-ass.
(coach Don Patthoff in 8th grade, when I made fun of him for being bald, and
he slapped me hard in the face).

<p>So maybe l was a jerk in early life, and some people probably think I still
am. Not sure what turned me around, if anything, and made me think more about
others than I do myself.. How did I change from being a guy who Bob Dean said
could "turn people off just by saying 'Hello'"?

<p>Starting in my home town, Delphos, I have been was exposed to lots of great
people, including doctors and nurses, who emulated the kind of person I really
wanted to be. But without question, the main factor in getting to be a better
person was MEETING KATHY, who doesn't get any better and nicer! Did some of
her niceness rub off on me?

<p>Memories of my Mom and Dad also influenced me, and I wanted to I may have
tried to imitate their attitudes. It would have been better off by trying
emulate them, especially my Dad. I don't remember him ever saying anything
unkind about someone else.

<p>One thing Randy Pausch didn't mention in The Last Lecture was the idea of
looking for ways to make others feel good about themselves, to complement them
when they do a good job. In my opinion. most people appreciate hearing this,
especially when given along with a smile and a pat on the back. - at least I
always liked to hear someone say nice words to me. Maybe this attitude has
helped in my unjerking.

<p>My health is actually not too bad for a 74 year-old geezer. Instead of
rattling off my numerous nuisance ailments, I will simply list some of the
specialists I saw in 2008 for various symptoms, starting at the top:
psychologist, neurologist, audiologist, ophthalmologist, dermatologist,
internist, neurologist, proctologist, podiatrist,

<p>(Seen in the not so recent past but not so far in 2009: ENT, psychiatrist,
internist, cardiologist, pain management specialist, physiatrist, infectious
disease specialist), ((And have Never seen: rheumatologist - one local guy
refused to see me for management of fibromyalgia Dxd at Mayo Clinic. I have
since learned that he is an extreme right wing pro-lifer. Although I consider
myself to be open minded and having middle of the road attitudes, I lean
toward being pro-choice. For example, if a pregnant women has a
life-threatening medical problem, I would not argue against her choosing to
terminate the pregnancy. These are situations in which both mother and baby
could be lost if the pregnancy is not terminated. But I hope and pray that no
one in my family is faced with this situation.

<p>A physician who treats himself has a fool for a doctor. But to survive the
current medical non-system requires the leadership of someone who is current
with all the personal data etc. At this point in time this individual happens
to be Good Old Bud. Speaking of time and people passing, the late Cincy Reds
broadcaster Joe Nuxhall always signed off at the end of a ball game with "Now
we're rounding 3 rd and heading for home." That's kind of where I am located
right now. You could say that I'm just taking a very short lead off of 3 rd
base. I certainly wouldn't want to get picked off base, and likely will not
try to steal home.

<p>REAL retirement looks a ways off. I plan to continue my two jobs - IRB work
and ethics committee activity, for as long as they're rewarding, challenging,
and fun. Or at least until I get canned from both!

<p>August 10, 2009.

<p>I have major surgery scheduled today: a large inguinal hernia. (previously
referred to as a "rupture"). I'm not too anxious about the procedure. It will
be done with general anesthesia (put to sleep). With any luck at all, I will
wake up at the proper time. But both of my parents had major complications
following their hernia operations. When I was in 7 th grade, Mom had surgery,
developed a post-op bowel obstruction, and required 6 weeks hospitalization.
She was seriously ill at the time, and knew it. Fortunately, she recovered and
finally came home.

<p>My Dad wasn't so lucky. At age 46, during surgery for a gangrenous
strangulated hernia, he had a heart attack, never woke up, and died the next
day. None of us knew that he was in really bad shape, with hypertension,
obesity, and undiagnosed severe heart disease.

<p>Perhaps my post-op recovery time will allow me the luxury of finishing this
damned biography!

<p>P.S. I did fine during surgery. As we used to say: "The patient tolerated
the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room. And then went home
later that day. Same Day Surgery has arrived in Northern Kentucky, and it
works just fine!

<p>OCTOBER 2009 KATHY MEDICAL MISSION WORK IN MACEDONIA.

<p>She continues her
great mission work, and I am very proud of her!

<p>Patrick came home to be with me while Kathy was away - what a great gesture
for his old man! Of course, none of our kids are "un-great". Each of them does
what they can to help out, and during my MS, have been especially nice,
helpful, and just altogether wonderful to me! Maybe they are more like their
Mom in this respect than their Dad!

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

<h1 class="page-break">2010</h1>

<p>February 2010 - THIS REALLY IS THE FINAL INSTALLMENT!!! At this point I may
not have much choice - I will need to finish the autobiography much sooner
rather than any-old-time later.

<p>The politically correct term for my current medical situation is that I am
now having some MEMORY ISSUES!!! Long term memory seems fairly good, but the
short term stuff is becoming inconsistent or fuzzy. A visit to my neurologist
Jim Farrell confirmed a major problem - Although the word wasn't said aloud,
the likely diagnosis and politically correct Terminology: The BIG A, or AD ,
OR the politically incorrect term: ALZHEIMERS

<p>At least it looks like some form of dementia. Recent testing was ok,
including BRAIN MRI which showed only my usual MS changes. The situation is
bad enough that Dr. Farrell started me on a specific med - Reicept, a drug for
specific use in mild, moderate, or severe Alzheimers (AD). Now if I can only
remember to take it!

<p>In early 2010, I considered going back to the Cleveland Clinic or Mayos for
another opinion, perhaps get into a study. Not really any kind of a research
project. But who would want to take a chance on using a placebo for the next 5
or 10 years, while gradually fading into the sunset? For now I need to get
more organized, including a "simple" plan with Kathy for daily activities, and
exercise program of some sort.

<p>((Maybe I will also start keeping a diary starting with the AD diagnosis
and its intricacies, if any, before I totally lose it - That is, if I can
remember any of it before I get started!))

<p>Finally, here are a couple of the great Frank Sinatra's songs, written by
the gifted Paul Anka reflect some of my own thoughts and feelings. First,

<blockquote>
<p>That's Life :

<p>"I tell ya, I can't deny it,<br>
I thought of quitting baby,<br>
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it.<br>
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try,<br>
I'd jump on a big bird and then I'd fly<br>
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king.<br>
I've been up and down, and over and out, and I know one thing:<br>
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face, I just<br>
pick myself up, and get back in the race.<br>
That's Life. That's Life and I can't deny it. Many times I thought of cuttin' out.<br>
But my heart won't buy it. But if there's nothing shakin' come this here July,<br>
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and just cry. My My."<br>
</blockquote>

<p> <p>And here is Sinatra's - and my own - ending, with his/my way:

<blockquote>
<p>My Way

<p>And now the end is near<br>
And so I face the final curtain<br>
My friend I'll say it clear<br>
I'll state my case of which I'm certain<br>
I've lived a life that's full<br>
I traveled each and every highway<br>
And more, much more than this<br>
I did it my way<br>

<p>Regrets I've had a few<br>
But then again too few to mention<br>
I did what I had to do<br>
And saw it through without exemption<br>
I planned each charted course<br>
Each careful step along the byway<br>
And more, much more than this<br>
I did it my way<br>

<p>Yes there were times I'm sure you knew<br>
When bit off more than I could chew<br>
But through it all when there was doubt<br>
I ate it up and spit it out, I faced it all<br>
And I stood tall and did it my way<br>
I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br>
I've had my fill, my share of losing<br>
And now as tears subside<br>
I find it all so amusing<br>
To think I did all that<br>
And may I say not in a shy way<br>
Oh no, oh no, not me<br>
I did it my way<br>

<p>For what is a man what has he got<br>
If not himself then he has not<br>
To say the things he truly feels<br>
And not the words of one who kneels<br>
The record shows I took the blows<br>
And did it my way<br>
Yes it was my way<br>
</blockquote>

<p>What more can I say? I really did do it my way. It's been a great ride,
even if it's now only in second gear.

<p>Without further ado (or adon't), I remain,

<p>Always and Forever,

<p>Bud

<p>July 2010
